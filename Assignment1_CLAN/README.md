# Language Development Analysis Using CHILDES Database

## Overview
This project explores language development in children by analyzing the influence of parental gender. Using data from the CHILDES database, the study examines whether children are more influenced by the speech of the parent of the same gender during early language acquisition stages.

## Contents
- **Hypothesis**: Children are hypothesized to show linguistic characteristics closer to the parent of the same gender.
- **Methodology**: Analysis focused on the Type-Token Ratio (TTR) and Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) across various child-parent data pairs using CLAN.
- **Results**: Mothers had a more significant influence on the children’s language development regardless of the child's gender.
- **Conclusion**: Mothers' language interactions with their children are foundational, involving a blend of high vocabulary levels and repetitive language that aids early language development.

## Data and Tools
- **Dataset**: Providence dataset from the **CHILDES** database
- **Analysis Tool**: **CLAN**
  
## Key Findings
1. **Gender Influence Hypothesis**: Initially hypothesized that boys and girls would mimic the linguistic patterns of fathers and mothers, respectively. However, results showed that mothers tend to influence language development more than fathers for both genders.
2. **Type-Token Ratio (TTR)**: TTR analysis showed that mothers and children had similar values, suggesting that mothers adjust vocabulary range to the child’s comprehension level.
3. **Morpheme Usage**: Analysis revealed that mothers used more complex morphemes compared to children, suggesting an advanced level of language tailored for child comprehension.
4. **Mean Length of Utterance (MLU)**: MLU analysis confirmed that mothers generally had higher MLU values, reflecting their role in expanding linguistic structures for children.

## Insights
- **Parent Gender Effect**: Contrary to expectations, mothers significantly influenced children’s language regardless of gender.
- **High-Quality Conversations**: Mothers used complex vocabulary and morphemes but tailored them in quantity to align with the child’s understanding.
- **Language Development Support**: This language pattern by mothers was instrumental in advancing the child’s MLU, indicating a structured approach that fosters linguistic growth.

## Conclusion
This study underscores the importance of maternal interaction in language development, highlighting the role of familiar and repetitive language structures. The findings suggest that mothers' conversational adjustments create an environment that aids in building foundational language skills for young children.
