9,"I have seen Charlie & The Chocolate Factory last night and though I usually don't care very much in giving my opinion, the journey M. Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.

I have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it ""reality"" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie & The Chocolate Factory is all about?It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with ""real"" sets, ""real"" Oompas Loompas, ""real"" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film.

After that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many ?the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.

Johnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those ""weird"" (a word he likes ?you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet?So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.

Danny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.

What can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.

As for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the ""family"" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the ""Edward Scissorhands"" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.

Thank you, M.Burton. Thank you very much"
9,"when i first went to the screening for this movie i was expecting it to be crap like the trailers suggested but i was surprised by how well made it is. this is an amazing movie that shows director Burton at his best. you all know the story by now so i won't waste time going over it. what i love about this movie is how they kept the things that made the original movie great and also added in their own wonderful stuff. the trailers and TV ads make Wonka look like an idiot or some freak but he's actually a pretty sweet man that's funny as hell. the kids are great too, although they get a bit annoying at times. danny elfman's music was also well done, it's not as good as the one he did for scissorhands but it still holds it own and the set design was amazing from start to finish.

this is a great movie that's well shot and done in every way. it might just be the first remake since dawn of the dead that doesn't suck"
9,"I was pleased to have this ""Willy Wonka"" re-make meet my expectations. Those expectations were high, at least in the visuals department. I expected a wild, colorful ride with brilliant hues and good special effects...and I was not disappointed.

It was inventively fun with those great visuals and another wonderful kid playing ""Charlie."" I doubted they could ever come up with another child as appealing and nice/wholesome as one in ""Willy Wonka"" but they found one in Freddie Highmore. He filled the bill magnificently, as did the ""brat"" kids.

A different feature of this version, as opposed to the 1970 original, was that here the Oompa-Loompas were all played by just one person, a very small Indian man named Deep Roy. One of the interesting ""features"" on the DVD details how difficult that was to do and how much time Roy had to put in to do all the things he did.

Johnny Depp, meanwhile, ""did"" what he always does - do a good job of playing a weird person. I get the feeling he relates easily to strange characters. He seems to play enough of them. This was the only part of the movie, frankly, where I preferred the 1970 version: the role of Willy Wonka. Yes, Depp was interesting as always but a little too weird, too Michael Jackson-like, for my tastes. I'll take Gene Wilder's take on the character.

Otherwise, this re-make has it all over the original, simply because it has 35 years of technology and computer work that the original wasn't able to have. It made this re-make a real ""hoot"" to watch. Since entertainment is what the business is called, and this movie is extremely entertaining, then I have no complaints. A fun two hours!
"
9,"Every bit of it hits you with amazing childhood memories. Watching it as an adult, you get to notice many dirty puns between Willy Wonka and Violet's mother almost explicit lol. The songs by the oompa lumpas are still pretty dull and useless though"
9,"Who says that a movie can't be dark and still be for kids? Sure, the original may have sugar-coated things a bit more, but it was still just as dark and disturbing as this one was! And that's OK. Has anybody heard of the Brothers Grimm? They wrote fairy tales that were still ten times as dark as this movie, and they were for kids, and many of us read them when we were kids. Kids are savvier than we give them credit for, and honestly, I think that adults would be more put off by the disturbing imagery in ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" than kids would. I saw this movie at a Friday afternoon matin?e in a theater that was FULL of kids, and the reaction seemed pretty positive to me. (And as far as some of the ""hidden"" risqu? jokes, I remember the same types of jokes in a lot of Disney movies from the late 80s and early 90s; it's a part of the kid's movie landscape now.) I thought it was an excellent movie, for adults or for kids. I also thought it had some touches that actually improved on the original; the set pieces were amazing, and there was more with the great glass elevator (like the book) than in the original movie, which I was pleased to see.

I thought I'd go into this being bored until they got to the factory because that was how I felt about the original, but even the opening scenes with the Bucket family, and Grandpa Bucket's flashbacks to his time working at the factory, are wonderfully entertaining. The unusual imagery starts there, with the gigantic factory ""ten times as big as any other chocolate factory"", and Charlie's weird, funhouse-like shack and eccentric but loving family. I was most impressed with David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, whose performance was all child-like wonder, and Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor were also good as Charlie's parents; and Freddie Highmore, who played Charlie, ought to have a decent career in front of him.

Once they do get to the factory, though, things really take off. Johnny Depp puts in an excellent performance as Willy Wonka, not an impression of Gene Wilder AT ALL, but as usual, making the character his own. Without a doubt, he's the best thing about the movie, but the imagery is amazing too. It's exactly what you'd expect from a Tim Burton-made adaptation of the book; his trademark is all over everything, and the result is stunning. And the kids are great too, as are Deep Roy as every one of the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle as Violet's mother, David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, and James Fox as Veruca Salt's father. From the start of the tour, the movie starts feeling like an acid trip, and the movie never lets go of that atmosphere. The result is amazing.

The only slow parts, I think, are those dealing with Wonka's childhood (although Christopher Lee is good as his father, I just thought they were a little boring and wanted to get back to the factory when they were on) and the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers, which I didn't think had the charm of those in the original (actually, I thought the musical number with the puppets at the beginning of the tour was the best one in the movie). The ending is also just a bit overlong, but the whole package is so good that the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses. You'll enjoy this movie, especially if you're already a fan of Tim Burton's work, but also, I think, if you're a fan of the original movie or the book; however, even kids who have never been exposed to any of this will be entertained. It's often hilarious, always a visual treat, and has something to offer for everybody."
9,"I liked the old WILLY WONKA film and when I heard they were going to do a remake, I was very skeptical--especially when knuckleheads on the internet kept started circulating rumors that Marilyn Manson was going to play the lead!! Fortunately, this was only a dopey rumor and I am pleased to say that I am glad they remade this film, since it sticks much closer to the book by Roald Dahl and because I liked the dark Tim Burton style. Unlike the original, this isn't as much of a musical and it has a wicked sense of humor. However, oddly, while being very dark, unlike WILLY WONKA, the film showed that the bad children were alright by the end of the film. If you never read the books, when you watch the original movie you might just think the brats died! Most of the reason the film is better is the clever script, though it didn't hurt that they were able to use modern special effects that were light-years ahead of the 1971 film. Additionally, while I liked Gene Wilder as Willy, the dark and twisted and possibly crazy Willy played by Johnny Depp was a hoot to watch. I also loved the new version of Oompa-loompas--so creepy and cool compared to the annoying orange freaks from the older film.

I liked just about everything about the new film. The only part I wasn't thrilled with was the tacked on epilogue which starred Christopher Lee. While I love seeing Lee in films (except when he was in the Star Wars movies--this is best forgotten), none of this was in the book and just seemed out of place--though also a bit fun. Purists (like myself) may not like this, but most out there probably won't mind at all with this addition.

Finally, I should point out that this is definitely a more adult version of the story. Young children probably should NOT watch the film--especially if they are impressionable of really, really young. However, for older kids, teen and adults, this remake is the better bet because it's funnier and quite clever and NEVER cloying or schmaltzy."
9,"I just saw this film in theaters and it was a LOT better than I thought it would be.When I first saw the teaser trailer for this I thought it would be terrible.Depp looked as though he imitated a version of Michale Jackson and the acting and directing looked pointless.Apparently I was wrong.Why the original movie probably was so popular was because Gene Wilder did a superb job as Willie Wonka{mind you I didn't like the it that much}.But you can definitely tell that this movie was done by Tim Burton.It was sort of different-strange but at the same time it was enjoyable and funny.The oommpa loompa's{or however you spell it} were however a bit too over the the top, and Willie Wonka's character didn't really suit the movie too much.But aside from that.It was smartly done"
9,"I'm a fan of Tim Burton, a fan of Johnny Depp and a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp together. I'm also a since-I-was-six fan of the classic Willy Wonka movie starring Gene Wilder. I was concerned that, despite the great experiences served up by Burton/Depp collaborations in the past, this one might fall short on sentiment and long on sarcasm growing from twisted trees. I shouldn't have worried.

This film is, as every Tim Burton film is, a visual feast that draws you into a world that seems a combination of the real and unreal. This is a far less sweetly musical telling of the story, but Danny Elfman's music is a perfect fit for Burton's quizzically malevolent vision. Johnny Depp delivers a performance that can only be described as subtle slapstick. His Willy Wonka is equally an eccentric genius and nervous innocent. Burton's direction removes a lot of doubt about Wonka's motivations, and makes it OK for us to love Charlie, both pity and admire Willy, and laugh guiltily at the four despicable brats who get what they richly deserve.

The Oompa-Loompas are not orange, a little wackier, and don't have scary theme music. The interior of the chocolate factory is less fun house and more never-ending stainless fortress. Charlie's family is featured more, and you find yourself wishing you could crowd around that big bed with them. Smaller children (under 7 years old) may be frightened by the puppet show, the boat ride or Veruca's squirrel scene, and unimpressed by some of the more nuanced humor.

The classic is more ""pure imagination,"" this one is more flaming puppets. The classic shows Willie Wonka working in his office, this one shows Willie Wonka discovering the Oompa-Loompas. It's quite unlike the prior film in it's look, tenor and musical treatment, but the overall theme of the good at heart winning out over the good for nothing is the same. It's wonderfully delicious.

>> SPOILER ALERT <<

There's no last temptation of Charlie in this film (he doesn't enter any forbidden rooms), so that means no last minute tongue-lashing from Willie Wonka at the end. Instead, we're taken along on an examination of Willy Wonka's life, and wonder if he will truly shun all notions of family and the outside world forever. This part is all Burton, not Roald Dahl, but is an interesting insight into what might have made Willie Wonka the way he was, and whether the one principal he rejected in order to create his perfect world must be ultimately embraced in order to enlarge it and make it better."
9,"Reading through some other reviews here I felt a dire need to write one of my own.

I went into an afternoon showing of this film with a group of friends whose ages ranged from 16 to 10, we were in a cinema packed to bursting with small children (think 5 or 6 years old) who had dragged along their parents. And the whole way through we were all laughing.

This wasn't a children's film that the parents had to suffer through, and it wasn't so childish that teenagers wanted to vomit. It was the classic tale we all know and love, only slightly modernised to reflect todays children.

I'll tackle the children first, while some remained completely faithful to their book roots (August Gloop, particularly) it was good to see that some had changed slightly to reflect how children are today (such as Mike Teevee who is obsessed with TV and violence, and Violet whose mother is constantly encouraging her to be competitive and a 'winner') These kinds of children are commonplace these days, we've all met at least one, and it helps the viewer to slide into the film with ease.

Johnny Depps' acting was inspired. It angers me to see so many people instantly seeing his performance as based on Michael Jackson when it quite plainly isn't. Perhaps the American medias obsession with Jackson in recent months is to blame for this. But what I saw when i first saw Depps' Wonka was a recluse, scared and uncertain of how to be around people. He needs prompt cards to introduce himself.

His detachment from the world makes him seem weird, quirky even, but it's good because the space he keeps between himself and others is the exact opposite of what Charlie teaches us, that we need our families, we need others in our lives, which is an important lesson for todays children who have become increasingly 'memememe'.

Burton has done another stunning job, visually. The colours of the chocolate factory are stunning, and you can feel that you've entered a world of imagination and left the, literally, grey outside world far behind.

As always Elfmans music is a joy, and reflects the quirkiness of Burtons' vision. The 'Welcome' song is hysterical and instantly you find that while you may know the story, you have no idea as to what's about to hit you. The Oompa-Loompas songs are, unfortunately, very hard to hear over the roar of the music which is a damn shame, but the dance moves alone will have you in hysterics.

It was refreshing to find things added into this film that we didn't see in Wilders' version or in the book. I particularly loved seeing how Wonka found the Oompa-Loompas.

While i was a little surprised to be shown flashbacks of Wonkas childhood throughout, i quickly accepted it, and found it interesting as it lead to another important message that todays' children should always remember, that sometimes parents stop you from doing things because they actually love you, not because they hate you, and that they just want what's best for you.

This film was a joy to sit through, i hung on every word, silently urging the characters on so i could see what was going to happen next, hear what was going to be said. I had to know, even though i already knew the ending.

This is the kind of film children should be watching today. This is what a summer movie should be. This is what happens when Burton/Depp/Elfman deliver."
9,"I saw this at a free screening, and first of all, before I talk about the movie itself, I'm going to yell at everyone who is trying to compare ""Charlie"" to ""Wonka."" It's ridiculous. Depp and Burton have stated, numerous times, that they are not ""remaking"" the first movie. They are making a new movie, based on the book. Depp has never even seen the old movie before, on purpose. Also, looking at the other side of things, they are NOT trying to purposefully be unlike the old movie either! If anyone thinks Tim Burton would be that petty, they don't know Tim Burton's attitude towards film making. Okay, now that that's off my shoulders. The movie was excellent. I went in not knowing what to expect and came out with a grin that wouldn't go away. The effects were great, the acting was magnificent throughout, and thank god they cast Depp instead of some of the other strange considerations they were thinking of. To some who say Jim Carey should have played the role, I say...dead wrong you are. Jim Carey has made one good movie, and that was eternal sunshine. He's not a good comedian and I hope he realizes that soon. Anyway, I digress. The movie was excellent, that's all there was to it, and I bet if the first one had never been made, more of you haters would think the same thing."
9,"It's a fact that Roald Dahl did not like ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory,"" the first adaptation of one of his most famous works. Years later, Tim Burton has directed ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" hoping to adhere more faithfully to Dahl's book. With Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the movie finds a darker tone. Depp's performance is a wonderful combination of a friendly man-child and a creepy character with dark secrets. The imagery is amazing, as Burton has done for many of his movies. Much has been made of such details as the waterfall of chocolate, and the specially-trained squirrels. While trying to be faithful to the original story, Burton adds a fascinating look at Wonka's background. What made him become a chocolatier? He was rebelling against his father, a dentist on an anti-candy campaign. This elements adds another strange facet to Depp's performance. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" has proved itself a tasty entry in Tim Burton's canon."
9,"This should be considered the ""ORIGINAL"" version of the book. Although the 1971 version was very entertaining, it was lacking the ""flavor"" of one of Roald Dahl's best works. Tim Burton did an excellent job recreating the book to the silver screen in what I consider to be a ""video"" version of the book! CHEERS!!!! The wonderfully strange Johnny Depp portrayed Wonka much like the book had described him. Don't be ""stuck"" on the Gene Wilder Version as it did not do justice to the story. Mostly Hollywood Hype & glitz & glamour was the selling point for the old version of this film. When you do decide to see this film, scrap all the ideas of it being like the 1971 version. Enjoy the film & consider it as a nice ""Stocking Stuffer"" for the upcoming Christmas season."
9,"This movie was wonderful! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. It was just as bizarre and creepy and magical and fun as Ronald Dahl's book. Don't bother comparing it to the other movie version, this one far surpasses it. I loved the back story for Wonka, it explains a lot.

This is a perfect movie for children of all ages. It teaches them about loving ones family and following ones dreams. And it does so in a lovingly sneaky way. The filming of this was done so well, it felt like a psychedelic Disney ride, annoying puppet songs and all.

Johny Depp did an amazing job as always. He really figured out how to pull off being creepy children's game show host while still being charming. He really made Wonka feel like an overgrown and misunderstood child.

I recommend this to all those who are children at heart."
9,"I saw ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" this weekend just after it opened, and all I can say is that I thought it was a heck of a lot better than the critics made it out to be. Johnny Depp played the part of Willy Wonka exactly as I had pictured him from the book, and it was a shock to know that this quirky chocolate maker had also been Capt. Jack Sparrow from ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" Talk about talent. Another thing was that the movie followed the book a lot better than the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" There were a few parts added to give Wonka some background, but nothing major. Plus, all of the other actors (the children, in particular) gave perfect portrayals of their parts. This is a must see for the whole family!"
9,"Sorry to make you upset, but isn't Charlie and the Chocolate Factory SUPPOSED to be dark, twisted, and scary? Look, the 1971 film was terrible. It was a critical and financial failure upon its release, and I'm not even kidding when I said that. The 1971 film was made just to be a feature length commercial for real life Wonka candies by Quaker Oats (no joke).

I am so tired of people saying that the 1971 film is far more superior than the Tim Burton version. No offense to Gene Wilder, but Johnny Depp is the true Willy Wonka. Slugworth wasn't needed, no fizzy lifting drink scene, no easily forgiveness, and all we see is exactly how Roald Dahl wanted. Sure, they may not've included Wonka's poem, but the tunnel scene is still creative and fun.

Seriously, if you read the original book, you'll know why people love the film. Sure, not every film based on a book repeats the book beat by beat, but Roald Dahl stories are different. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a critical and commercial success. It stayed true to the original source material, it has better writing, and the bratty kids actually get punished for their bratty actions.

It's like this film doesn't believe in karma houdinis. Seriously, you can NEVER top the 2005 film. Can you top the 1971 film? Absolutely!"
9,"It's hard to describe your experiences in a Tim Burton movie. They are odd, to say the least, and sometimes creepy. Sometimes they are colorful, and sometimes they're black. But they are always something special, and Burton doesn't let us down in his latest flick ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."" It's a moving coloring book, with stunningly beautiful colors and creative sets and costumes. It just makes me sad that the real world isn't this rich.

The most common misconception about the movie is that it is a remake of the timeless ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" It's not. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't a remake, but rather another adaptation of the classic children's story of the same title. Keeping true to the book, screenwriter John August mixes quirky humor and creepy tempo to concoct one of the year's best movies.

""Charlie"" is a story of an ordinary little boy named Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). He was not faster, or stronger, or more clever than other children. His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected; in fact, they barely had enough to eat. But Charlie was the luckiest boy in the whole world, he just didn't know it yet.

Charlie lives with his family; his two parents and his four grandparents. His grandparents: Joe, Josephine, George, and Georgina, never leave their bed, and Georgina is a little out of it, to say the least. Charlie sleeps next to a hole in the wall, which can be quite cold in winter, but he doesn't care, because the hole allows him to look at the greatest chocolate factory in the world, the one belonging to Willy Wonka.

After some fifteen years, Willy Wonka decides to open his factory gates꿧or five lucky people. He places five golden tickets in five ordinary Wonka bars, the finders of which win a tour through his amazing factory. As people around the world frantically buy Wonka bars in search of the tickets, they are slowly found, one here, one there. Charlie desperately wants to go to the factory, but he only gets one bar of chocolate a year, on his birthday.

Johnny Depp gives one of the best performances of his career as the eccentric chocolate entrepreneur Willy Wonka. His exotic style and off-beat jokes almost mock Michael Jackson, but are original in its own. Depp leads an already all star cast including Helena Bonham Carter, Christopher Lee, and Deep Roy (who might as well be the star of the movie). Tim Burton directed it, and Danny Elfman created the score.

No one ever thought it, but Charlie has actually surpassed its predecessor. Burton has delivered another classic, putting it up there with Edward Scissorhands and The Nightmare Before Christmas. But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory isn't just mere entertainment, it also teaches us something. It reinforces the age old themes ""greed is not a virtue,"" and ""curiosity killed the cat."" But all virtues aside, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is definitely worth a viewing or two, and is by far the year's sweetest movie."
9,"I haven't watched the first version supposedly mixed of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" (1971) dismissed by Roald Dahl and so I will eschew any comparison with this long-anticipated cover directed by Tim Burton. I watched it a few days ago and the first thing that comes to mind about it is that Tim Burton's version is a wonderful example of how the adaptation of a book for children for the silver screen can be transcended into a stylish, prime rendering. Anyway, when I heard that the filmmaker of gems like ""Edward Scissorhands"" (1990), ""Ed Wood"" (1994) or ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999) planned to give a fresh cinematic rendering of Roald Dahl's work, I thought it was highly likely to be a triumph by any standards. The novel alchemy of these two authors worked wonders to deliver a ""Burtonian"" film to the core. From film to film, the filmmaker pursues his exploration of the strange with these offbeat characters who are generally outcast and the inclusion of the whimsical in the everyday life.

To make the 5 little lucky children visit the coveted dream factory, Tim Burton's imagination is in full swing. It's visually a feast for the eyes with a succession of quirky, fanciful moments fraught with oddball ideas and bathing in an ocean of colors. It is pure rapture that is prevailing in the viewer's mind who is sliding in pure wonder before so many used visual, thoughtful effects and devices to deliver a solid portion of dream and escape.

""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" also ensures continuity with Tim Burton's precedent works because analogies can be found with several of his previous films. A town with many houses and shops gathered and at the edge of the city, a somewhat isolated, mysterious place where lives a bizarre outcast who generates fascination among the inhabitants. Doesn't it remind you of ""Edward Scissorhands""? Moreover, the machinery system could be an echo of Edward's inventor's. Then, if the town has realist British accents in its architecture, Charlie's house seems to be built in a Gothic one and Tim Burton's taste for Gothic trend stands out once again after having come to the forefront in ""Batman"" (1989) or ""Sleepy Hollow"". The interior of the house includes amusing details: Charlie's grandparents spend most of their days in a big bed. At last, the end of the film is similar to ""Big Fish"" (2003) insofar as it showcases the lack of communication between Wille Wonka and his father and their reconciliation.

To come back to the story, the audience is caught in a jaunty walk behind the walls of the chocolate factory just like the visitors and however, this state of bliss seems to be short-lived. This place has something ominous like a big haunted house from which one couldn't escape with its long corridors and spacious rooms. Something the viewer feels when the visitors are at the threshold of the firm with the mechanical dolls singing and dancing before finally being burnt. This fanciful, almost fictional world conceal doubtful, unnerving parts, beginning with Willy Wonka himself. Under his wry, laid-back appearance, this character has an eerie part of ambiguity. He is cut off from the exterior world and barely worries about the unfortunate fate of the 4 smug young imps and one can fuel doubts about their mishaps: were they premeditated? Finally, Willy Wonka has to come to terms with the demons of his past to be in peace with himself and to be a human being.

Of course, as a whole, one could object that the form tends to be favored over the contents with a rather linear master plan especially with the installments concerning the four pretentious brats who are punished of their own sins but Tim Burton keeps his distance from the moralizing, stereotyped aspects of the storytelling. ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is also a tale that shelters emotion and tenderness mainly brought on by Charlie's grandfather.

The cast is equal to the sum of the story and its treatment. Johnny Depp who had already acted in a so-so movie dealing with chocolate, ""Chocolat"" (2000) by Lasse Hallstrom can be once again grateful to Tim Burton to have conceived him a tailor-made role for him in which he's constantly fit in.

All you have to do is to sit down and savor a well-rounded delicacy from a connoisseur in storytelling who added one more canonical contribution to a monument (a figurative sense for his filmography) that cuts a fine figure. Go on like that Mr. Burton! Would Roald Dahl have appreciated this bracing result?"
9,"With all the expectations surrounding this film and the shadow of the earlier version, I wasn't sure what to expect from Burton....but I have to say this is one of the most entertaining films i have seen in a long time. Although it's a kids story, and I was expecting a kid's film, it's impossible not to get lost in the magic of the whole thing. The story, of course, is fantastic to start with thanks to Dahl, but the big screen version manages to absorb you completely and brings it to life brilliantly. It's beautiful to look at and somehow, completely believable! Jonny Depp is amazing and definitely manages to steer away from merely recreating the Willy Wonka from the last film - fantastic and disturbing all at the same time. The whole cast works brilliantly together and Charlie Bucket is definitely one to be watched for the future.

This version sticks to the book a lot more, so is quite different to the older film and also offers a lot of laughs for kids and parents alike. The sets are beautiful and the whole thing looks like a bag of candy from start to finish! As with most Burton films of course, there is a dark side to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that makes the film really interesting and leads it to be a lot more than just a kids film.

As you can probably tell i really enjoyed this film lol :P and it's one DVD i'll definitely be buying on it's release. In fact I may just go and watch it at the cinemas again now...."
9,"The Wizard of Oz, Charolette's Web, Mary Poppins, and of course Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory were my favorites as a kid. I remember popping popcorn and spreading my sleeping bag out on the floor directly in front of the television to be sure I had a front row seat for the very rare occurrence of a network special presentation for one of these films. Gene Wilder will always be The Candyman that made the world taste good, and I still hear his voice to this day singing those exact words. Mr. Wilder, you've brought joy and laughter to millions throughout your career, and as far as Hollywood Legends go, you truly are the Everlasting Gobstopper.

Now about this time last year when word of the remake started to circulate the headlines I thought what is happening to Hollywood. You can't just simply remake such a beloved classic. Then word reached my ears that Tim Burton was set to direct and Johnny Depp to star as Mr. Wonka. I then saw hope, for they had chosen an actor I believe could pull off anything, and Johnny Depp delivers a fantastic performance.

The story, with slight alterations at the end, remains practically unchanged. Even the sets and wardrobe hadn't appeared to have strayed too far, however there seemed to be a darker feel or perhaps a sinister undertone to the overall film and specifically the character of Wonka. I'm guessing Director Tim Burton may have put some personal touches on the film that are unique to his dark, but intriguing style. And with the help of such a talented actor, that he obliviously favors, it's really no surprise the end result would dazzle the audience. Depp delivers us a more eccentric and sarcastic Candyman, where Wilder was more enthusiastic, humorous, and witty. Either way, all the pieces fit and a new generation will get to enjoy a wonderfully surreal Chocolate Factory."
9,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is great film and I would recommend it for anyone. Somehow Tim Burton is back on track with his excellent direction of this film so close to the book. Roal Dahl should be proud. Johnny Depp as always is excellent and play a great Wily Wonka. The original is brilliant but I find the second one to be far more what Charlie and The chocolate factory should be. Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka Just as Micheal Keaton will always be Batman. But this film has to be one of the most fun and well put together of this year. If you haven't seen it go see it and don't expect the original. Johnny Depp is great the film is cast better and seems to flow a lot better than the first movie. Umpa lumpa dippy de do I've got another puzzle for you.
9,"Don't mind about the trailer,which is quite ridiculous indeed:this is Tim Burton's best movie since Edward Scissorhands and Batman Returns.

Roald Dahl's unforgettable novel is faithfully brought to the screen,as we see poor boy Charlie (Freddie Highmore,much more cheerful than in Finding Neverland)winning a trip inside the local chocolate factory. And it is an AMAZING factory:almost entirely built from scratch,with limited use of CG,it's a pure and simple visual joy,reminiscent of when the director gave cinematic life to Gotham City. Along with Charlie there are four other kids,perfectly played by the young actors.The only problem is the obnoxious, TV-obsessed Mike Teavee (fitting surname, huh?),who's even more boring than in the book,the only character you really hope will get in trouble. The Oompa Loompas,all played by the same actor,Deep Roy, are very enjoyable,even in the musical numbers,not really necessary ,but charming (they're voiced by Danny Elfman,whose score is terrific as usual).

This really is a Tim Burton movie,and you notice that from the beginning:the snow falling down and even covering the Warner Bros.logo,the camera moving inside the factory,which reminds of the opening sequences of Batman and Edward Scissorhands,the thrilling music... He's even made it more personal by adding an interesting back-story involving Willy Wonka and his father(a welcome return to creepy characters for Christoher Lee). Which brings us to the real reason you watch this movie,the amazing chocolatier...Johnny Depp! He's not acting, he IS Willy Wonka,and he's obviously enjoying himself,portraying someone who's twice as mad as Jack Sparrow,sorry,I mean,Captain Jack Sparrow.Depp and Burton working together is always a guarantee of quality,and this fourth collaboration of theirs is a perfect return to the weird,slightly Gothic movies that made us love them,after their recent,and rather good by the way,mainstream efforts(Big Fish and Pirates of the Caribbean). Don't get me wrong,children can watch,and love,this film,but it really is something everyone should enjoy,no matter how old they are(actually,when I saw the movie,there were only 4 or 5 kids,and 20 adults).

I haven't seen the original movie with Gene Wilder,but thanks to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp,this version is already a classic. I'm really looking forward to seeing Corpse Bride and any other movie they might make together.

Batman Begins aside,this is the best film of summer 2005."
9,"Goth kids and women everywhere united in one voice when it was announced that Johnny Depp was going to be playing the well known Willy Wonka in a movie directed by Tim Burton. Calendars were marked and people were ready to see the successful team of Depp and Burton redefine movies again. As the date of release grew near some people I talked to were getting nervous. Would Depp go too far? Is such a thing even possible? Still, I went out the first day of release ready to see what the verdict would be and if the expectations were set too high.

As the beginning credits roll we follow chocolate being made by sophisticated machines with Danny Elfman's music setting the pace. We meet Charlie first, a normal kid who's day ends with cabbage soup every night with no complaint, is played by Freddie Highmore, who stared with Depp in Finding Neverland in 2004. He does a wonderful job playing the sweet boy who makes the best of his family's low social status. The sets have Burton's hand on them, with the slight cartoonish feel to everything we see. This continues when we meet the other children who will follow Wonka on his factory tour- Augustus Gloop( Philip Wiegratz) with his rosy complexion and chocolate smeared face; Veruca Salt( Julia Winter) her blue eyes glittering like her mother's large ring under the attention of the cameras with her prize; Violet Beauregarde( Annasophia Robb) has the cool blond hair matching her white skin giving her this cool, unemotional attitude and Mike Teavee( Jordan Fry) with his eyes taking over most of his face as though he's watching everything but with a very unhealthy dose of skepticism. The children all did an amazing job personifying their bad traits and I was very happy to have more about Violet than in the 1971 version. Burton gave the children their moments to shine just as much as Charlie, which I thought was missing in the earlier version.

Depp as Wonka was perfect. He gave the character a little more depth, a man who made candy but didn't even like children. The flashbacks to Wonka's childhood made more of Wonka than a crazed candy maker giving him layers and ideals behind his love of candy. The children and Wonka seem to be at odds the moment they enter the factory but being as Wonka hasn't had human interaction in years, it isn't out of place. His sayings and quick wit responses to the children may not make as much sense to the younger viewers but parents will appreciate them. Wonka's sidekicks, the Oompa Loompas ( played wonderfully by Deep Roy) were the perfect compliment to Depp. The songs and dances, different from the 1971 version, all had a different theme and attitude which added to the difference between the children and their faults. These dances were without a doubt some of my favorite scenes in the whole movie.

In the end, you have to forget what you know about Willy Wonka and Charlie and the factory. Forget the happy-go-lucky Wilder character and indulge in a new and more faithful version of the story. The acting was all amazing, the sets were colorful and made you unsure of where to look next, as a trip to a real Wonka factory would have been like. Depp has created another memorable character along the lines of Jack Sparrow and with such a supporting cast, this movie makes a great treat for anyone."
9,"As a young boy growing up in the 1980's I got to see Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (WWATF). Of course I fell immediately in love with the movie. I can remember begging my parents to rent it from the video store so I could watch it again and again. Then imagine my surprise that I learned there was a book out by the same name! I checked the book out of our local library and was amazed at how different the stories were. I was about 12 when I read the book, and loved every minute of the book. I then checked out the sequel, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. I was even more amazed at how bizarre that book was. I learned to appreciate the two separate entities (the book and the movie) as works that stood on their own. It never entered my mind to think of one as being dependant on the other.

Last year when I saw the trailers for Charlie and The Chocolate Factory (CATCF) I was shocked at the outcry from the public. The ruining of Gene Wilder's performance seemed to be the motivating force for these comments. I could not understand, and still don't understand why people see this movie as a remake of the previous movie. It isn't a remake of the 1971 WWATCF - it's a remake of the BOOK. That being said, I am not going to compare this version to the book, I'm going to compare it to ?itself and the 1971 movie.

My reasoning behind this is simple. The only movie to get to about 90% accuracy on the book was the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Each movie is over 2 hours in length and there are three of them. That's a lot of material. Of course a LOT of the material that was in the books was left out, otherwise you'd be watching each movie for over 6 hours at least! Our society is not a book society. Therefore I'm reviewing this movie with and eye to the 1971 version.

****SPOILERS AND REVIEW DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE!**** One can't help to compare this film to the other, but the comparisons add to the fact that this movie is a stand-alone. It does not follow the book exactly, but closer than the original film.

I gave this movie and initial 10 on my rating. Then I thought about it, and dropped it to a 9. I'll explain why later.

This movie, in my own opinion, is a much better visualization than the 1971 movie. Lets face it, WWATCF was great for it's day, and I'm not disputing that, I'm disputing the vision of the director. This one was visually more interesting. The house that Charlie and his family live in was very - well - pathetic. We, as normal people, all realize that any building in reality would be condemned and that you would get very sick eating nothing but cabbage soup every day. But the deplorable house, with snow outside the gaping hole in the roof next to where Charlie sleeps, is just pathetic enough. Not enough for them to be living under a bridge, but JUST above that position.

The chocolate factory exterior was much grander and more desolate in it's grays. The interior is much more whimsical. You could see the scope of the size of the factory from the entrance. My thought was ""wow - a lot of people must have worked here."" Grandpa Joe was played admirably as the tottering old man of the family who wishes he could just once get another look at the place he worked.

My only - and ONLY gripe with the movie - the reason it got a 9 was the acting by the parents and the children. When the children were in danger of demise - the parents looked shocked - but not very scared. More along the lines of ""I can't believe my child was this stupid."" Case in point - Mr. Salt. When his daughter is being ravaged by wild trained squirrels - and he just watches. Any parent worth his salt (pun intended) would have been over that two and a half foot barrier in a second to rescue his child! The ONLY kid who seemed scared and concerned about his own fate was Augustus. The pathetic ""HELP"" as he disappears from sight in the chocolate machine actually made me concerned.

None of the other children - even Charlie seemed overtly concerned that these kids could be DEAD! Wonka - (Johnny Depp). I can't say enough about Mr. Wonka. He was just as reclusive, anti-social, whimsical, and real as I could have wanted. He had no idea how to act around children. He had no idea how to act around adults. Talk about eccentric! There were a few moments after some of his comments when everything got quiet - and you could feel the tension. No one knew how to react. Just has it should have been. To steal a line from Dr. Evil ""Ooooh - this is awkward."" THAT is what Wonka is to me. He plays the socially inept genius that LOVES candy perfectly.

One can't help to compare this film to the other, but the comparisons add to the fact that this movie is a stand-alone. It does not follow the book exactly, but closer than the original film.

Overall I loved this film, and will be seeing it again in the theatres."
9,"I admit that I went to the theater with apprehension, having grown up with the Gene Wilder version of Roald Dahl's wonderful story, but I was soon transported into a fantastic film that exceeded almost every expectation. If you are a fan of the book (meaning that you have read the book more than once), you owe it to yourself to see this cinematic version. They say ""don't judge a book by it's cover"", well I say, don't judge a film by it's leading actor, or previous versions that you may have seen of the same story. Johnny Depp is no Gene Wilder, but then this is not Gene Wilder's film. Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka, and that is all that really matters.

There is a subtle sub-plot that was invented for the film which I found a little disturbing, but even with this addition the film was still very enjoyable. I'm not going to give anything away, but suffice it to say that the added material only goes to enforce the morality story that is the main thrust of the original book.

The last Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film that I saw was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and I must say that I was more than a little worried about Tim Burton's handling of this joyous material. Again, I was overly worried for no reason! The colors are bright, the characters are played to perfection by the young cast, and Johnny Depp gives a stellar performance as the mysterious, slightly screwy candy man.

""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" was a great film for the 60's, but there were limitations to the technology of the day. For a technologically fantastic film that more closely follows the source (albeit with one glaring, disturbing plot addition), I would highly, and exuberantly (is that a word), recommend this film!"
9,"When I read most of the reviews, I saw that a lot of the people were Tim Burton fans. When I heard that he was going to remake this timeless classic, I thought ""well here goes another great movie down the drain""...don't get me wrong Tim Burton is OK but not really my taste.....Boy was I wrong....I had the great pleasure to see this wonderful movie yesterday with my son, we both had a ball, we laughed and laughed. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka was perfect and the special effects, fantastic. I' really not a great believer of re-makes being better than the original but this one far surpasses the original by LEAPS and BOUNDS...."
9,"Tim Burton has redeemed himself with this interpretation of the classic story by Dahl. He has put together a group of talented and charismatic performers who bring out the spirit of the original story and enhanced it with amazing production values. Yes, it's different and at times, it feels odd, but it contains a good message which it delivers in quite an entertaining manner.

The beginning is reminiscent of ""Edward Scissorhands"", introducing us to Charlie's family and setting up the big scenes to come. Freddie Highmore's Charlie Bucket is a sensitive and quite mature youngster who has been raised with good values by two generations of his family. They echo the strong family relationship of ""The Waltons"", and Burton makes sure the early scenes display both sweetness and uniqueness. These folks might be honest but they are also very interesting to listen and look at.

The early segments also introduce us to the other four children who play important roles in the development of the story, and it's a hoot to see some of their introductions. Here's when we first encounter the twisted sense of humor that connects the rest of the film and makes the experience in the factory a true delight.

There are moments in the factory scenes when Burton appears to be trying a little too hard; however it is the originality of his approach, coupled with some of the most incredible art direction presented in a modern film that makes the film a treat. There are a couple of musical number that would have inspired Busby Berkeley.

He might not be the main reason the film succeeds, and yet his performance is once again a triumph of the amazing talent Johnny Depp has. His Wonka is to put it mildly ""odd"". His speech and his facial expressions captivate, repulse, and hypnotize at the same time. He commands the screen and easily fits into this wondrous universe.

Be ready to enjoy the ride and appreciate that Hollywood is capable of creating magic. Here is a film that justifies big budgets and respects the value of good source material. Depp, Burton, and Hightower are names that Oscar should keep in mind at the end of the year."
9,"This retelling of Roald Dahl book is funtastic! Within the first twenty minutes of the movie, you care about every member of the Bucket household thanks to those Freddie Highmore doe eyes, and Grandpa Joe's facial expressions.

Surprising, there are many similarities in this version to the original version, which director Burton has stated he disliked so much. That may be how we learn the original was closer to the book than we initially imagined.

Johnny Depp's Wonka is offbeat and sometimes disturbing. However, he wins us over with his eccentricities of verbally sparring with each of the children. Missing, however, was the warm connection with Charlie, which is a surprise, consider the connection Depp and Highmore had in the previous joint venture (Finding Neverland.) The entire visual of this movie is a joy to look at. The chocolate river ride is much more enjoyable and much less disturbing than the original version. Danny Elfman's music adds the perfect layer of sweetness to the rapid riding.

However, the big winner of the night is Deep Roy as every single Oompa Loompa. Delivering the only musical numbers in the movie, Roy dances with glee and determination, keeping himself deadpan, and clearly enjoying himself. He may be small in stature, but he will be a big star soon.

I was pleased, yet disappointed that Tim Burton seem to hold back on his usual colorfulness. This move was kept calm and didn't cross the line into the bizarre.

There were, at time, many things to look at, so this movie deserves multiple viewings in order to take it all in."
9,"When I first heard that Tim Burton was remaking the 1971 version of ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" due to it's questionable loyalty to its source, I literally jumped with joy. As a hardcore Roald Dahl fan, I absolutely despised the earlier version. I hated the fact that they had made this rather dark fantasy into a sugar-coated sickening-sweet fairytale. And although Gene Wilder is a wonderful actor, I also felt that his portrayal of Willy Wonka was completely incorrect. So, if you absolutely loved the 1971 version, I've got a strange feeling you probably won't feel the same way about this film.

John August, who wrote the script for this version, is much more loyal to the book, except for a few additions (ie flashbacks of Willy Wonka's childhood). Tim Burton finds this amazing balance between beauty and darkness through his direction, something that was never achieved with the 1971 film. The child actors are perfect to a T in their roles, especially Freddie Highmore as the lovable Charlie Bucket. Johnny Depp portrays Willy Wonka as if he's Michael Jackson on acid, and although that may seem extremely scary and bizarre, it works here.

All-in-all, Tim Burton has created a modern-day classic that both old and young should be able to appreciate and enjoy. Roald Dahl (RIP) would be proud."
9,"I went into this film expecting a 10 star film, but came out thinking it was even better. this film starts slow, and knowing the story you want it to speed up, but once it gets to the factory you are wanting it to slow down, so the perfectly wonderful film will last longer. Johnny Depp was a wonderful choice for Willy Wonka, and Freddie Highmore I am convinced is one of the best child actors to ever set foot on the screen. the less known child actors are also great in the roles of the other children, and I especially liked Mike Teavee's performance. The music, written and performed by Danny Elfman was wonderful and reminded me of his early songs while he was with the band Oingo Boingo. I truly think this is Burton's best film in a LONG time. and at the end everyone clapped, something I haven't seen since Lord of the Rings."
9,"A marvelously delectable, albeit bizarre and ingratiating concoction, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" assembles enough ""freaks and treats"" for deliciously satisfying entertainment that will have you scratching your head in bemusement in strange areas and licking your lips in its visual feast. The new ""Wonka"" tale of the fantastic world of sweet delights is far less ""charming"" in terms of innocence and conventional in terms of story structure than the Gene Wilder version of Dahl's masterpiece, but rather, it deviates as an eccentric, thrilling, and downright psychedelic adventure into the realms of fruitful imagination and awesome aberration. In some respects, it's still that endearing little tale of a wondrous happening realized for an indigent little boy, Charlie Bucket, who dreams of bigger and better things, yet stays dear and true to his family in any matter. Freddy Highmore instills the adorable innocuous, curious, and faithful nature of Charlie Bucket, and gives us plenty of reason to cheer for his golden day of fun being realized, even after the selfless lad initially declines the ""golden ticket"", out of concern for his family's living conditions. On the other hand, a child of a different nature, Willy Wonka, is explored on less empathetic terms, and we can only gather from his various reflections that his eccentric, uncanny, and somewhat eerie nature is founded on repression and emotional neglect, leading him to eventually realize that ""chocolate is the only thing that makes sense"". Willy Wonka, we come to realize, is one strange, unadulterated hermit, who has compassion for his ""Oompa-Loompas"" and a zealous proclivity for chocolate, but has little concern for anyone or anything else the world over. Perhaps nothing can explain some of his capricious, agitated tendencies, or his ghastly, gleeful countenance, or his mousy articulation, or anything else, for that matter. Through the bizarre and fascinating journey through Willy Wonka's factory, we become immersed in a visual feast of dazzling set designs, gorgeous colors, and marvelous, innovative visual effects that enthrall our senses and compensate for whatever bizarreness we encounter along the way from Depp's ""Wonka in Neverland"". It's a wickedly gorgeous, thrilling, and freaky adventure of a movie that can be sweet and ravishing, fruitful and wondrous, or bizarre and zany whenever it pleases, and we get a sweet taste of it all throughout. For those who detract and even dismiss the cinematic quality of the film for Depp's ""zany, over-the-top, creepy"" interpretation of Willy Wonka, I would argue that one can easily get past this weirdness by absorbing all of the visual splendor, or beating to the trippy, zany Danny Elfman score, or appreciating some fantastic talent all around from the adorable cast of children, to enjoy a perfectly delightful film experience. It's wild and crazy, but it's also sweet, thrilling, and fascinating- a real treat for those who can stomach Johnny Depp's bizarre, inexplicable antics, and I can assure you, there are plenty of reasons why you can. I wouldn't entrust my child in this Wonka's hands, but I wouldn't deny my child this wonderful cinematic experience, either. I'll take Tim Burton's crazy and exciting trip in Willy Wonka's wondrous factory any day over flocking to much of the uninspired, banal refuse that's normally hogging multiplexes in the summertime. You don't even need the heart of a child that explodes with joy at the finding of that last golden ticket to enjoy this ""Chocolate Factory""- just bring an open mind and a thirst for adventure and visual delight, and you may discover a real treat indeed. Much of it may even dance in your mind long after a regular ""sugar rush"" and some of the Oompa-Loompa singing numbers are not to be missed or forgotten! "
9,"One of the better films to come out of the remake factory, Tim Burton's version of Roald Dahl's beloved book is an unqualified success.

Setting aside memories of the 1970s Gene Wilder Willy Wonka, here we have Johnny Depp with ghostly pallor, squeaky giggle - altogether a more creepy and weird prospect (and very like Michael Jackson, whether this was intentional or not).

Charlie Bucket - cute little Freddie Highmore - is so obsessed with Willy Wonka and his factory that he has built a replica in his house. he only gets one choccie bar a year but hopes to find the elusive Golden Ticket which will get him into the factory. The first four tickets are snapped up by stereotypical kiddie horrors - Angustus Gloop, who just eats and eats; Veruca Salt, a spoilt brat from Buckinghamshire; Violet Beauregarde, gum chewing, kick-boxing American champion; and Mike Teavee, obsessed with the flickering box in the corner of the room and his noisy Playstation.

Of course Charlie gets his ticket, too (it wouldn't be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if he didn't) and off we go into an inventive trip around a magical, crazy place populated by numerous identical Oompa Loompas (lots of computer generated Deep Roys singing and dancing in formation). The fun as ever is seeing how the horrid kids get their just desserts during the trip.

Illustrious casting (James Fox, Helena Bonham-Carter, David Kelly, Liz Smith, Christopher Lee) and fabulous special effects (the Great Glass Elevator; the river of chocolate; the trained squirrels; the Oompa Loompas), together with Dahl's dark humour, make this a confection to be savoured.

May be a little scary for the smaller child, but this is a surprisingly good film. Wonka's character is a little more developed than in the earlier film, and although the ending has been tweaked in true American saccharine fashion, it works. It has the feel of a Christmas release rather than a summer blockbuster, but there's nothing wrong with that.

I especially loved the Oompa Loompas' different musical styles for the songs, from disco to heavy metal - inspired!"
9,"When my husband and I heard that Tim Burton was making a new film version of Roald Dahl's CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY starring his favorite leading man Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, the world's quirkiest candy maker, we knew it would be a perfect match of filmmaker and source material, and indeed it is! Burton's inventive imagination and dark, twisted sense of humor suits Dahl's gleeful misogyny perfectly, yet still results in a family-friendly film simply because, like Depp's Willy Wonka, it doesn't pander to the young'uns. Indeed, Wonka doesn't even seem to like the golden-ticket-winning kids he invites to his weird and wonderful confection factory, though in his own oddball way Wonka eventually warms up to our hero Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore). Who wouldn't like the selfless, poor-but-thankful-for-his-blessings Charlie, especially compared to the four spoiled brats competing against him for the ""special prize"" Wonka dangles before them? The kids' acting styles work well, with young Highmore's un-actorish down-to-earth quality playing off well against the appropriately flamboyant brattiness of AnnaSophia Robb (as super-competitive Violet Beauregarde), Julia Winter (Veruca Salt, the overindulged rich kid), Jordan Fry (Mike Teevee, now an aggressive video game freak as well as a television addict) and Philip Wiegratz (Augustus Gloop, a sweet-faced but selfish glutton). Wonka is also given a back story of funny yet poignant strife with dad Christopher Lee, a dentist (!) who takes his work just a little too seriously. This angle could have been as overly sweet as a bad piece of candy, but the cast, Burton, and screenwriter John August work it gracefully into the family theme. Unlike Wonka, Charlie has a loving relationship with his eccentric family (all played with warmth and wit by a cast of fascinating faces, especially David Kelly as Grandpa Joe, Noah Taylor as Charlie's dad, and Helena Bonham Carter as Charlie's cabbage-soup-making mom). It helps that Depp and Highmore have good chemistry. (Fun Fact: Depp recommended Highmore to Burton after working with the lad in FINDING NEVERLAND. Another FN veteran in the cast: Eileen Essell of DUPLEX fame, playing Charlie's Grandma Josephine.) With Alex McDowell's production design, Philippe Rousselot's lush photography, and Gabriella Pescucci's costume design, the movie is deliriously gorgeous to look at, like a collaboration between Edward Gory and Peter Max. Thanks to the deadpan performance (or should I say performances? :-) of a CGI-multiplied Deep Roy, along with Danny Elfman's fabulously fun score -- with songs based on lyrics from Roald Dahl himself, yet reminiscent of Elfman's work with Oingo Boingo -- the Oompa-Loompas' production numbers are a delight to watch and listen to (no cover version of ""The Candy Man,"" sorry! :-). Our whole family had a blast -- CHARLIE... is the tastiest sweet-and-sour sugar rush of the summer!"
9,"And this is one of those times that that just isn't true.

That said, it's truly difficult for me to compare this movie to the original; they hold two rather different moods. Johnny Depp's performance as the slightly eccentric Willy Wonka just seems different than Wilder's some 30 years ago. Where Wilder is the wise, witty man behind the factory who breaks out into song every now and then about imagination, Depp is flat-out weird. He almost seems a bizarre mix of Michael Jackson and Freddy Kreuger, yet he pulls it off perfectly. He's just not the kind of guy you want taking care of your kids, because he laughs and dances as they turn into behemoth blueberries, get sucked up giant pipes, and get dragged around by squirrels. And then he encourages you, the parent, to do the same! So why do we like this all-too-creepy man who just watches and waits as one by one, the children fall prey to some bizarre trap designed perfectly to ensnare the children based upon their oh-so-annoying faults? Honestly, I don't know. The viewer will find an aura about Depp as he acts, however, that, simply put, entrances the viewer into wanting to see more, to learn about his horrible, candiless past, and to learn of how he shamboozled the Oompa-Loompas into doing his nefarious bidding.

Or something.

And it doesn't hurt that the cast surrounding Willy Wonka is simply amazing. Each of the children, their parents, the Bucket family, and the Oompa-Loompas find themselves delivering top-notch performances. Honestly, I think the only character who might have been more fleshed-out would be Adam Godley, the man who plays Mr. Teavee. And yes, I know that perhaps he wasn't as fleshed out in the book. All I'm saying is that maybe it would've been nice if they had given him just one more joke or stunt. The family, especially Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina, are family-like, if that makes sense, while still being hilarious.

The musical numbers... honestly, they were a good change, though I will complain, as I so often do, in the fact that I really couldn't understand everything that was being said by the Oompa-Loompas. Still, they provided absolutely hilarious interludes between each child being taken away.

The factory, the main set of the movie, finds itself as being an environment that is a pure joy to view, with its colors, shapes, puppets, animals, and most importantly, candy everywhere one looks.

And all of this comes together to deliver a unique, enjoyable, and refreshing experience. Masterful."
9,"I thought that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was an excellent movie. I think that Johnny Depp portrayed Willy Wonka quite well, and the only thing I thought could have been improved was the Oompa Loompa songs. I thought they were good, but could've been a bit shorter. I thought that Tim Burton did a great job making this movie, and although friends of mine disliked it, I thought it was great. They said that they hated the Oompa Loompas and just over all the entire movie, but as I said before, I thought they were good, just a bit of a shorter song would've been nice. I also liked the ending of the movie, which, although different from the book, worked out quite nicely.

Yes, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was an excellent movie, which I would recommend to anyone."
9,"I find it interesting to see so many people referring to this movie as a remake of the earlier movie with Gene Wilder. The way I see it, both movies are simply remakes of the fantastic vision described in Roald Dahl's book. Neither movie is perfect, but of the two I significantly prefer Tim Burton's effort.

Part of this simply comes down to a bigger budget and 34 years progress in special effects of course, but Burton's directing style and flair for juxtaposing the surreal with an exaggerated version of normality is just tailor-made for this job, and he does not let us down. The sets are beautiful, and the characters, with the exception of one, are spot-on perfect renderings of Dahl's caricatures.

Curiously enough, I think the weakest point of both movies is in their portrayals of Wonka himself. Gene Wilder was sufficiently eccentric, but just a tad too genial. The Wonka of the books has a distinctly callous streak and a cruel sense of humor. He obviously takes great delight in seeing the bad kids get what they deserve, for instance. On the other hand, Depp's Wonka perhaps goes too far the other way. He has the right kind of flippant indifference, but also has too many moments of self-doubt and uncertainty. The Wonka of the books was above all supremely confident in his own abilities. The flashbacks to Wonka's past in this movie just seemed to weaken the character.

But at the end of the day, these movies are adaptations and certain changes are inevitable. I liked Depps's Wonka, even if it wasn't quite what I expected.

A few highlights, in case you're not already convinced:

The songs. I was laughing non-stop through every one... And unlike in the earlier movie these songs actually use Dahl's original lyrics.


The effects. As you'd expect from Tim Burton, the film is a weird and wonderful visual feast. A perfect match for Dahl's quirky ideas.


Depp. As ever, a masterful performance. Even more deranged than the book version, but an interesting take on the character.


The story. Except for some slightly unnecessary diversions into Wonka's past, it by and large it follows the book, which is a good thing.


The kids. Each and every one is a perfect stereotype.


The Oompa-Loompas.


The 2001: A space Odyssey references (and other movie references, e.g. Depp with the scissors in the beginning).


Just about everything else...


If I had to pick one other flaw, it would be that the movie takes a little too long to get going in the beginning. But just hang in there, wait for the factory gates to open, and enjoy the ride...

Bring on the Great Glass Elevator!"
9,"Oh how the child in me reveled in this beautiful re-imagining of the Roald Dahl classic! As someone who never liked the 1971 film, it was so refreshing to see Burton's take on it, and Depp's exceeding SUPERIOR portrayal of the reclusive, strange Wonka. Many have criticized his performance, but those who are criticizing need to understand the source material a little better. Those who have read the book but still didn't appreciate Depp's performance should at least appreciate what he was reaching for. For me, every word out of Wonka's mouth was hilarious, and the special touches and ""inside jokes"" involving Depp and Burton's other films together made it even more enjoyable and worth a repeat viewing.

The sets were gorgeous, and the Danny Elfman score was perfect as well as his adaption of the Oompa Loompa lyrics from the book. In fact, the Oompa Loompas were fantastic.

The only aspect that kept this movie from being 10 stars was the back story with Wonka's father. I thought it slowed the momentum of the film, but not enough to detract from its magic."
9,"First, I would like to state that one of my all time favorite movies is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but from reading the early reviews of the fact that it was NOTHING like the first movie, I went in with an open mind. I took my two children (6 and 10) who absolutely loved the movie! My son usually has trouble sitting through movies but had no problem with this one. I loved how this movie gave the background to why Willy Wonka was the man he became by showing scenes from his childhood. The Gene Wilder version was more about the children where this movie was about Willy Wonka and the children. The scenes in the factory were amazing --- even better than the first movie! The only negative thing I would say is I enjoyed the music more in the first movie than this movie.

I highly recommend this movie for everyone. This is the best family movie of the summer so far!!!!"
9,"Tim Burton and Johnny Depp do it again for me. A great director and actor duo the best since Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro. Johnny Depp knows how to bring a character to life, if you're looking for someone to play an eccentric character these days then get Johnny, Films such as Ed Wood, Pirates of the Caribbean, Sleepy Hollow and the recent The Libertine all show how much life Johnny puts in to his characters, he plays them Jack Nicholson style, over the top but definitely not pantomime. Tim Burton's visionary is better than ever after the dreadful Planet of the Apes he got back on form with Big Fish but that didn't show how visionary he can be, this is Tim Burton full on reminding me of the Beetle-Juice and Edward Scissorhands (another great Burton-Depp Collaboration) days.

This version definitely ain't no remake, Burton as definitely stayed loyal to the book, you can see this by just looking at the title, no shits that we call Hollywood producers have got their hands on this and changed it to 'Willy Wonka' and as for all the haters of the new version out there, Roald Dahl hated the original thats why he never gave them the rights to make Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, which no doubt probably would have been titled 'Willy Wonka's Great Glass Elevator'. So if Roald Dahl hated the original so much what does that tell you? so think on before saying a classic has been ruined because for me a classic much loved book was ruined by the Gene Wilder version. I will admit although the Gene Wilder version was a bit of a classic for me, especially the Ooompa Lumpas. I've got to hand it to Tim Burton and Johnny Depp they have won the golden ticket with this version, the script is great and the directing is beautiful, and the on screen chemistry between Johnny and Freddie is fantastic, as was it in Finding Neverland, you feel like they're father and son. Definitely a must see 9/10"
9,"Why oh why do people insist on comparing this movie to the 1971 version? I realize everyone is entitled to their opinion, but why can't this movie just stand on it's own? I am tried of hearing ""You can't help but compare it to the original."" YES YOU CAN! The 1971 version was a fantastic movie, and we all loved it as kids and most of us still love it today, but let's face it folks, it's not a truly great movie! For it's time, the effects were great and the set pieces were all really cool, but the acting was not exactly Oscar worthy!

***SPOILER ALERT - IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, SKIP THIS SECTION*** The only

thing I will say is that I could have done without the backstory about Willy and his father. To me, that's just dumbing down the audience. The screenwriter should have just left Willy as an enigma. We do not need to be told why he is the way he is.

I am glad they left in the scene from the book where Charlie sees the other children as they are leaving the factory at the end.

I also do not care that they changed the Golden Geese to trained squirrles or that they left out the Fizzy Lifting Drinks.

***SPOILERS OVER***

My advice is to just go see the movie. The sets are amazing and the story is closer to the book than the original version. Of course they changed a few things.

By the way, that's another pet peeve of mine, when people complain that they change things from the book or leave things out. People need to understand that it's incredibly difficult, most times, to be 100% faithful when adapting a book to the screen. When people read a book, they read at their own pace. They put the book down, walk away, re-read certain passages, etc. When you adapt for the screen, you have to pace the movie so that the average person can keep up. Also, you have to trim some stuff or, for the most part, all movies would be 4-6 hours long! Go see this movie and enjoy it on it's own merits. If you don't like it, fine, but don't hate it because it's different than the first one or because it's different from the book."
9,"DO NOT.....I repeat DO NOT go into seeing this movie with the idea of comparing it to 1971's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I'm reading all these reviews and I keep seeing people compare this movie to the 1971 version.

It is better to consider this movie an original, rather than a remake. While the story has the same basic principal, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory stays more true to the original book than does the earlier film.

Johnny Depp give a very eccentric performance as the great Willy Wonka. At first you love him, then you hate, well maybe not hate but dislike him, and in the end you love him again.

The scenes were there are many Oompa Loompas leave you amazed know there is only 1 actor playing all of them. Their songs are a little difficult to hear, which is one drawback, but it's great seeing Johnny Depp's reaction to them when they are singing.

Overall I would say the movie is very good and you can definitely tell that Tim Burton was at the wheel of this movie, his style is stamped all over. I would certainly recommend this movie for all those looking for a good time at your local cinema, and remember don't go in looking to compare it to the 1971 adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel."
9,"I just had the pleasure of seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and as a fan of the original, I must say...WONDERFUL JOB!! It seems in todays world of remakes, the original story is lost, or some of the most important plots are forgotten; not here. True to the original, with a hint of originality! In my opinion, if they had cast anyone BUT Johnny Depp in this role, it would have been a waste! His sarcastic comments and facial expressions are most enjoyable and had me laughing through out the movie. I could compare it to Shrek: Created with kids in mind but still VERY enjoyable for adults! My only issue w/the entire move is some of the music that is sung by the oompa's, as sometime the words are hard to understand, but I guess even the chocolate factory needs to get upgrades these days. Great family movie, enjoyed it completely! Great Job, Great Casting, Great visuals, Great fun!!"
9,"As one who grew up with the original Wonka, I found Burton's rendition to be a treat! Most moviegoers know the fantastic quality of both Roald Dahl and Tim Burton and have a fairly good idea of what to expect, but I never expected to be delighted and entertained in a such a detailed way. Burton and his crew have examined every aspect of the film to make it visually captivating and patent-leather glossed.

Burton pays tribute to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"" and the original Gene Wilder film in the TV chocolate scene. The usage of Strauss' ""Also Sprach Zarathustra"" did NOT go unnoticed in an excellent homage to the Kubrick film.

I was slightly disappointed by the absence of the Fizzy Lifting Drink scene! I wished Charlie would not be such a little angel - let's give him a chance to be a kid instead of a responsible adult trapped in an eight-year-old body.

Depp's performance as the creepy-eternal-child with a voice from MILWAUKEE was delightful. (I kept thinking Kitty Foreman from That 70's Show) He captured the egocentric, but righteous and just character perfectly. His green-gray face and perfect lip coloring did creep me out, but the purple rubber gloves were a perfect touch. What's with the giant goggles - I kept seeing Elton John somehow.

Thanks Tim and crew for a wonderful take on an old favorite!"
9,"Whatever you do, do not think of this movie as a ""remake."" It isn't. This film is a completely fresh approach to Willy Wonka based strongly on the book itself.

Truthfully, I thought the beginning of the film dragged just a bit, even thought the look and visual feel was amazing. But once we are introduced to Willy Wonka - pandemonium and riotous giggles ensue! Every word that comes from Johnny Depp's perfect Willy Wonka is a gem - guaranteed to make you laugh or your jaw drop. Truly, Johnny's performance MAKES the film.

Freddy Highmore, as Charlie, is pitch perfect. It doesn't hurt that just to look at him makes your heart break. Every time he appears on screen you want to grab him and hug him! But this talented boy plays Charlie as a strong kid who takes what is given him and makes the best of it. He is happy as long as he has his family. Absolutely brilliant!

Deep Roy as the Oompa Loompas was terrific as well. Burton really went the right way with how he portrayed the Oompa Loompas. Couldn't have been done better. And the musical numbers performed by the tiny men are some of the films best highlights.

Bottom line is - GO SEE IT! You won't be sorry. A film-going experience has never been sweeter!"
9,"This comment contains spoilers, so if you don't want anything spoiled, than just read the second paragraph below. I have just seen this movie, and I was completely speechless! Tim Burton, Danny Elfman and Johnny Depp have collaborated once again. This remake of the classic ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is very well done. The special effects are astonishing (effects that could not be done back in 1971), there were a lot of funny lines, and it was also scary at some parts (what else would you expect from Tim Burton). The intro during the opening credits was a little scary, because it didn't give much of a feeling like we were looking at a chocolate factory, but it was kind of cool that we got to see Wonka placing the five golden tickets on five completely random Wonka bars. The Oompa Loompas were also well developed as well as the songs they did. In the original, they sang their song with different lyrics for each rotten little kid, but in this movie, each kid got a completely different song! The way the other four kids were developed was a little disturbing to me. Verucca was sort of the same as she was in the original, but I think she scared me a lot more in the original than she did in this one. In the original, Augustus was dressed formerly, but in this movie, he's dressed like a typical chubby kid; his personality is still the same, though. Violet's a blonde in this movie, and she's also a martial arts champion; in the original, there was no real exploration to what Violet did for a living. Also in the original, Mike was obsessed with TV, but in this one, he's obsessed with video games; also in this movie, Mike is a lot ruder, and he doesn't really talk much about what he's into. Another thing that made this movie different from the original are the parts where Wonka thinks back to his childhood, which kind of made me feel a little sorry for the character. At first, I thought nobody could do Willy Wonka like Gene Wilder, but Johnny Depp did a wonderful job! As for the ending, unlike the original version, we actually get to see what happens to the other kids. Adding on, Tim Burton said that this version was going to follow the book more, so I was kind of fearing that this movie was going to end the way the book ended with Grandpa Joe just saying, ""Yippee!"" Fortunately, it had an all new ending different from the book and the original movie.

For those of you who haven't seen this movie yet and want to see it but don't want anything spoiled for you, all I'm going to say is, be prepared for an amazing movie!"
9,"Better than the first with an even better cast. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore as Charlie Bucket and David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. The three actors and their characters were so good together that I really felt a true realness about them. Stunning visuals of the grand chocolate room and the amazing boat ride sequence really started Willy Wonka's grand tour with a bang. One thing I could never have been aware for was the quirky Oompa Loompa songs. Original and yet modern, Danny Elfman is a genius. Along with the casting, all of this really made for a great movie. Hoorah for Tim Burton! It really felt like a Burton film and was done so as to feel like it really was coming out of a story book, which of course, it was. Tim Burton is either a genius or completely nuts but either way, he certainly knows how to put on a show. Go see it! Go see it!"
9,"I LOVED this movie. I was a little nervous about going because Johnny Depp seemed like a scary Willie Wonka from the commercial and made it look retarded, but I wanted to see it because I was recently in the play 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' so I now LOVE the story. The movie was hilarious though! I loved how Willie kept having flashbacks from childhood, and finally he says, ""I'm sorry, I was having a flashback."" ""Do these flashbacks happen often?"" Mr. Salt then asks. ""Increasingly... today!"" Willie replies. And the fact that all of the oompa loompas all had the same face! LOL And the robots! Everyone thought they were kinda childish and pointless, except Mrs. Gloop, who was kinda dancing along. And when they exploded, it was so funny! And then Willie pops up by Mr. Salt clapping. And then later with the 'recently added' robot hospital. ROTFL!!!!! The only major thing I didn't like is that the actors/actresses didn't react much. When the kids reached their eliminations, the parents didn't freak out much. In the play we were told to really react. I probably freaked out more in the play for my one part than all four parents combined. I just think they should have been a little more upset, but otherwise it ROCKED!!!"
9,"This adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was great. Of most of us would be a little bit skeptical about this movie because we all grew up with the original and already felt it could not be duplicated. Tim Burton could not have did a better job with this movie. The Cast was perfect. Johnnie Depp was hilarious. He was the best Willy Wonka ever. Tim Burton and Johnnie Depp make a great team as we will see in The Corpse Bride in September. Also, this movie will make you want a gang load of chocolate too. After watching the movie, I went to buy and Big Kit Kat. This movie was great and I can't wait for to hurry up and come out on DVD. If you haven't seen this movie yet, get off your butt and watch it."
9,"This film was so much more fun, even as an adult. The characters had more character, in general. There was more character development going on. There was more going on to keep your attention. It was funnier and there was humor for children and adults. Everything about it was just better. I've watched it more than once and enjoyed it each time. I enjoy older films too but the original just didn't do anything for me. A genuinely good movie for family movie night!"
9,"Willy Wonka promotes a tour through his chocolate factory, the greatest in the world, through five golden tickets hidden in the bars of chocolate.

Charlie Bucket finds one, for the pride and joy of his very supportive family, and he spends the day in a mysterious competition for an unknown award with other boys and girls..

After Burtons last remake/re-imagining (the monkey one with Marky Mark), i was very worried about this choice of movie. The original was a phenomenon, with probably one of Wilders most remembered roles.

I knew was Depp was going to be in it, and that all the other Burton trademarks would be present, but still, i had my doubts.

How wrong i was. Not only in my opinion does it exceed the original, but we are treated to the back-story of Wonka, which makes him more human in this version, rather than a mystical being in the original.

Depp is shockingly brilliant as the candy maker, and has a little bit of darkness to him. We rarely see him concerned about the welfare of the children when they become at risk, but obviously that is the whole point of the film.

Burton really digs deep with connotations of the seven deadly sins, and all of the main characters (Wonka, and the children) resemble one of the sins, if you can read between the lines.

But don't do that on your first viewing, enjoy the colourful sets and wonderful performances from all involved. It's much easier to watch than the original, and the dark to light contrast in narrative flows easy in the film.

A brilliant remake, well worth catching."
9,"Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), the owner of a biggest chocolate factory in the world, put five golden ticket randomly in his Wonka Bars inviting the holders to come for one day tour in his mysterious factory. For poor Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore), who can only gets a Wonka Bar once a year on his birthday, the chances for a ticket are extremely slim. But good thing always come to the one with good heart. At the last day, Charlie won the chance to join 4 other children from all around the world; the spoiled Veruca Salt (Julia Winter), the competitive Violet Beauregard (Annasophia Robb); the fat Augustus Gloop (Philip Wiegartz) and the violent Mike Teavee (Jordon Fry). Together they start their journey in the magnificent Willy Wonka's factory.

Tim Burton is great! He successfully created a visual that seems a combination of real and unreal. This movie also features an outstanding performance by all casts. Johnny Depp gives us an eccentric genius but innocent Willy Wonka, Freddie Highmore is a perfect Charlie, and the four other children and their parents are fit in their role as amusing irritating characters : D This movie also good in playing with emotions. We all know that Charlie's gonna find the ticket, but you just can't stop your heart from beat faster when the time is come. What I like least about this movie is the Oompa Loompas' songs. I don't know why I got scary feeling about them :( But I can say that this movie is greatly enjoyable. Nothing could be sweeter. Well done!"
9,"Well, again Tim Burton has proved what a wonderful imagination he has, with his remake of the Roald Dahl classic; Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The movie has everything, a great story, wonderful dialogue, and most importantly, great characters! On some factors, it differs in ways from the book, but Tim Burton definitely knows what audiences want, and these added in subplots are amazing, with the extra depth they bring to the film.

Freddie Highmore does an incredible job of portraying the young Charlie Bucket, immediately pulling strings with the audience, adults and children alike. Johnny Depp, as always, is magnificent in his role as the eccentric Willy Wonka. His character development throughout the film provides the audience with a character not so much whom they can relate to, but rather, one who they cannot bear to wait for the next piece of his dialogue. Everything that comes out of Depp's mouth in the film has been written to entrance and entertain, without any over-the-top rude or shocking remarks, a great challenge in todays world of 'shock comedy' as I once heard it referred to. The film's other characters are equally well written, and serve their purpose well, that is, to be disliked by the audience through the entire length of the movie. The Oompa Loompas deserve a critique of their own. The actors amazing ability to be funny and solemn at the same time is great! And the songs, well, as with everything else in the movie, they have been well written. The only criticism of this movie that i have is the ending, Burton did not follow Dahl's original idea for the movie, and instead finishes it, whereas, i believe this movie would have had great interest in a potential sequel, with Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator. It is possible for anyone, any age to see this movie and enjoy it, and if you cant smile at least once, all i can say is where is your sense of humour?"
9,"So I've spoken to a lot of people ( some who haven't even seen the film ) and it seems that while there's been those who welcome Tim Burton's adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, there's a general consensus that ""..oh, but you can never replace the original.."". Well, bloody hell, no one is trying to replace, or even remake, the original film. Its an ADAPTATION of the BOOK people, so stop being so damn precious about the original. No one is doubting the grandiosity of the first adaptation, and this version is not trying to replace it.. its just catering for audiences over 12 years old... Having said that, it is an absolutely fantastic film, much much much better than the first and one that will keep the audience feeling uneasy with its sugar-sweet dark quirkiness. Johnny Depp takes Willy Wonka to places Gene Wilder could never dream of..and this version is much more faithful to the book. SO, for cynics i have this advice.. watch the first on video and then see Burton's in the cinema..and if you're still not convinced, then read the bloody book so you can prove to yourself which film does it more justice."
9,"It's just what you'd expect from Tim Burton and Roald Dahl. The combination of director and author is perfect - and so is the film. It's not Tim Burton's best but it's absolutely worth the way to the movie theatre. If you like Big Fish or Nightmare Before Christmas, you'll love this one. It's colourful, weird enough to love it, and at the same time very carefully composed. The sweetness of the chocolate seems to ""infect"" the whole movie. All gestures and words seem to be carefully chosen without trying to make it annoyingly perfect. All the ideas, the author's as well as the director's, make you smile and wonder how someone can actually create such a wonderful yet strange atmosphere. Despite all the sweetness, there is some bitterness and some melancholy in this picture which is marvelously acted out by Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka. Charlie is that perfect kid without being in whatsoever way annoying. It's a lovely film and it would be a ten if it wasn't for Sleepy Hollow or Edward."
9,"I grew up with the original film (never growing tired of it), and I always loved Gene Wilder's acting. I had also read the books, so I was very dubious about a new film, considering some of the remakes that have left a bad taste. I read reviews that said it was not a remake, but a new interpretation of the story. As the film started, I did not at first know what to make of it. It did not take long though to realise that I was watching something special. Depp is nothing short of brilliant in the role of Wonka. I have not laughed so much in a long time. His constant ""Mumbling"" comments to Mike TV in response to his baffling scientific statements was hilarious. Also the line ""You're weird!"" had me in stitches.

Tim Burtons sets and use of colour were great. It had a slight feel of ""Edward Scissor Hands"".

All of the cast were brilliant. The Oompa Lumpas were different to the originals, but still very funny. It was also nice to see Christopher Lee again on the big screen.

I always ranked the original film as a children's classic along with ""The Wizard of Oz"", ""Chitty, Chitty, Bang, Bang"" or ""Mary Poppins"" etc.., but I must say that this new film has earned it's place in this hall of fame.

I will definitely buy the DVD when it comes out."
9,"I'd heard lots of other people say that Charlie is ""weird"" in this version of the movie - people who think this just don't get it.... or haven't read the book.

It is a classic Tim Burton movie and Depp is at his best. The make-up, the outfits, the warped humour..... it's all there. The build-up to the actual factory visit is excellent, we were all gripped and excited, like we could actually win a ticket ourselves!!!

The only negative thing I have to say about this movie is that I thought the Oompa-Loompa singing sections went on a bit too long although they were brilliantly done (I don't know anyone who likes singing in a movie!).

The effects are superb to delight the kids and the grown-ups will love the humour. See it..... I want to see it again I loved it that much!"
9,"Last night, for the second time this summer, I walked into a movie that I was extremely worried about. With Batman Begins and now Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I had a really deep fear that the films would be terrible, yet that the hype was so good that I'd end up saying I liked them. With both movies, I did end up liking them, but because they were genuinely GREAT movies.

With Charlie, there were so many questions. Will it be better than the original? Will it stick to the story since it is, in fact, named after the Roald Dahl book, unlike the original movie? Will Johnny Depp make us all forget about Gene Wilder? As soon as it started, I knew it would be great. Danny Elfman did the soundtrack, and brilliantly so. Whatever the scene called for, be it the orchestral arrangements in the opening few minutes, or the clever new Oompa- Loompa songs, everything fit musically.

All of the members of the Bucket family were enjoyable and well played. Freddie Highmore was perfectly cast as Charlie and had that charisma that made it impossible to root against him. David Kelly was great as Grandpa Joe, and I really enjoyed Grandma Georgina's oddball irrelevance. Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter were well cast as Mr. and Mrs. Bucket. On that note I would like to say I was glad there was actually a Mr. Bucket in this movie. In the original they played with the story a bit and said he had died. They even had his toothpaste- cap-screwer job exactly as it was in the book in this movie. Well done, guys!

The other children gave me mixed reactions. Augustus Gloop was not a hard act to fill. Just a fat boy who eats and eats...and eats. Nevertheless, he was entertaining. I liked the little girl that played Veruca, though I think in retrospect the girl who played her in the original was better. Anna Sophia Robb, as Violet, was my favorite of the brat kids. I did NOT like Mike Teavee at all. For the way the script was written, I guess the kid played the role well. But the problem was with the script. Mike was WAY too intense. (Though I did quite like how Johnny Depp constantly made fun of his 'mumbling')

Ah yes, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy...aka Willy Wonka and the Oompa Loompas. At first I thought Depp was forcing his role a little, but I grew to like how he was so much quirkier than Gene Wilder had been in the original. For me, part of Willy was how he acted when placed around other people, when he'd alienated himself completely from the outside world. There would be a bit of weirdness in this situation, and Depp pulled it off nicely. Deep Roy was good as the Oompa Loompas. I loved their new songs, but the costumes weren't doing it for me. Plain old orange and white like in the original would have been better if you ask me.

The movie LOOKED spectacular too. That's one of my favorite Tim Burton trademarks - his ability to create totally magical worlds. From the dark, odd environments of Nightmare Before Christmas to Big Fish and now Charlie, scenery is where his true talent lies. The Chocolate Room exemplifies this perfectly. When that door opens and the kids walk in, how can you not think to yourself 'Tim, you da man!'?

They stayed true to the story, Johnny Depp was outstanding, and this movie was way better than the original. What more do you need?"
9,"It's notable that the bulk of negative comments about this film are from people who haven't read the book. If they had, they would realise why Dahl hated the original movie, as it not only deviated from the plot, which I can forgive, but deviated from the spirit of the book, which I can't. Dahl was the master of modern-day children's literature; he knew that as well as comedy and happy endings, children love the sinister and the surreal. The original film kept the surreal (alas that 70s clich? kind of surrealism) but discarded the sinister, replacing it with twee Hollywood glitz and sentimentality. Gene Wilder is a great comic actor, but his Wonka was all wrong: for the most part far too friendly, and then far too nasty when the movie pointlessly had Charlie breaking the rules. Basically, the original film is execrable.

Burton's version is infinitely better, and surely Roald Dahl would have loved it. It sticks to the book's plot, dialogue and characterisation almost religiously, and Burton's style is a perfect match for Dahl's. Johnny Depp is great; I never used to have much time for him but he grows on me with each of his films that I see. His Willy Wonka is less self-assured than that of the book, but it works very well, and the addition of his childhood flashbacks, though superfluous, is actually quite well done and adds a bit more depth to the character. As for the Michael Jackson thing, well, my friends and I noted that too, but really only because of the pale face and squeaky voice: Wonka may be weird, but not THAT weird.

The use of British character actors to play Charlie's family is great too, but I'll admit that as I'm British I always saw the family as British when I read the book, so having an all-American cast wouldn't have been right for me. Unlike many, I thought that the Oompa-Loompas were brilliant and the songs were hilarious, my only gripe being that Dahl's lyrics couldn't be heard properly above the music. The sets were magical too. In fact the only thing that grated with me was the British actors using Americanisms such as ""candy"" and ""pants"", but that's obviously completely forgivable given where the bulk of the potential audience lives, and if I remember correctly, the book used Americanisms too.

To sum up, I've been looking forward to a respectable film version of the book for over 25 years, and finally it's arrived. Surely they will have to do the sequel ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"", and I for one can't wait."
9,"I went to see this movie with my husband and our children, along with some of their friends. Commenting on the fact that it was directed by Tim Burton, my husband had already stated that he was not going to like this movie, but was going for the sake of the kids. Unlike myself, he found nothing of entertainment value in ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"". We were pleasantly surprised. The movie is very true to the book and, having read the book MANY times, it was refreshing to see a director finally get it right. The songs by the Oompa Loompas were all taken from lyrics written by Ronald Dahl himself in the book, but set to tunes and dancing that provided amusement beyond what you would expect. Burton and Depp do an excellent job of portraying Wonka as what Dahl intended, a crazy chocolatier who faces his mortality and realizes that he must open his world to children, whom he obviously does not like, in order to ensure his legacy. Depp really deserves an Oscar nomination here . . . the nuances of his craziness are perfect. Freddy Hightower, who has already proved his acting chops in ""Finding Neverland"" seals his fate as the young actor to watch.

While this movie is highly recommended, I have two tiny, and I mean tiny, complaints. The first is what I consider to be the unnecessary addition of a back story to Wonka to explain the method or reason behind the madness. This wasn't contained in the book and, to me, felt either contrived because there must be some reason Wonka is the way is (can't he just be what he is without explanation) or, I suspect, to add a moral lesson to the movie, i.e. the importance of family. Not every movie has to teach a lesson, and that is why it is called entertainment, and I felt the back story to be unnecessary other than to give us yet another good performance by Christopher Lee, portraying Wonka's dad. The other complaint I have is the portrayal of Charlie's mom by Helen Bonham Carter. While I have no real complaint about her performance, i.e. its not bad, I didn't feel that she really added anything to the movie, which may not be her fault given that Mrs. Bucket is, at best, a very minor character in the film. However, having seen Ms. Bonham Carter's acting abilities at their best (check out ""Lady Jane"", ""The Wings of the Dove"" and ""Howards' End""), it would sadden me to know that she has resigned herself, as she has most recently, to mainly appearing in her boyfriend's films.

Overall, I found this movie very entertaining and can't wait to see it again on DVD. Will there be a follow-up ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" Mr. Burton?"
9,"The idea of the story is still the same. Charlie (Freddie Highmore) is a poor boy, who lives with mother (Helena Bonham Carter), father (Noah Taylor), Grandfather (David Kelly), and 3 others grandparents in a very small shack. They live in a town where Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory is the most major mystery. Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) puts a golden ticket in five of his ""Wonka Bars"" and sends word that whoever finds a golden ticket gets a tour through his massive factory.

In contrast to the version of 1971, Willy Wonka already lets the people know that the winner of the kids gets the grand prize(whereas in the 1971 version, it was said that it was a life supply of Wonka Chocolate for all of the kids). The kids are now symbolized much more as some of the 7 deadly sins in this version and the parents genders changed in two places. The scary boat scene has been changed and Charlie is also portrayed as much more innocent because Burton did away with the soda pop scene. The songs are totally different and the ending was much more different.

These changes should have been easily predicted when the job was given to Tim Burton(who does everything his own way). I can't compare which movie was better due to the fact that the movies are so different. They are both good in their own ways. Don't expect the original from 1971, expect a totally new movie and you will enjoy it. Tim Burton did an amazing job and this movie will go right there with the classics (Edward Scissorhands,Batman, Sleepy Hollow) Johnny Depp was a much different Willy Wonka (more humanized) but only he and Burton could pull it off. Depp and Burton did it again! Freddie Highmore's acting was also as fantastic as it was in Finding Neverland.

I highly recommend this movie."
9,"I'm not one for remakes, because lately remakes are just raunchy vulgar redos of what use to be good family shows (IE Dukes of Hazzard.) But I have to say Tim Burton was genius when it comes to Charley and the Chocolate factory.

not a huge fan of the original (It was before my time, so as a kid I didn't appreciate ""older"" films), so I wasn't looking forward to seeing this, but the twist in the story, the brilliant way Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka, the children in the movie, the visual... it all wrapped together in a perfect movie.

Depp was wonderful in the role. I don't know who else could have played Wonka the way he did. There were a few minor scenes that were disturbing... the squirrels beating the rich girl up as she left nail marks in the ground where they dragged her away, and the melting singing puppets were a bit disturbing. lol.

but other than that, the movie would definitely be a good family movie... for kids older than 6 because of the squirrel thing. I'm 28 and that freaked me out a bit. lol.

Great movie though. Best this year so far! I can't wait for the next Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration- ""The corpse bride."" There is magic when those two get together."
9,"Seeing the earlier version as a child and recently rereading the book, I was very interested in also seeing Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate factory. Although I did enjoy the earlier version with Gene Wilder and appreciate the film's creative ingenuity for its time, I really enjoyed Burton's take on the same story.

For the most part, I felt Burton did an excellent job with casting and creating the characters to be authentic, as in the book. Characters such as Charlie, Grandpa Joe, Veruca Salt, and Augustus Gloop seem to come alive in the film directly off the pages from Roald Dahl's book. The film seems modernized with Violet's character and her ultra-competitive mother, which provides some additional social commentary to the parents' roles, not just the spoiled and ill-mannered children.

The special effects, as expected, were impressive. It's interesting in watching the earlier version where there weren't as many special effects used (or available at that time, for that matter)and noticing that it did not affect the film's overall quality. After seeing Burton's version, though, it is an eye-opening experience as to the advances that have come along in film-making. It's almost as though you didn't know that you were missing these in the older version.

Overall, I felt that Burton's version was much closer to the book than the original (which is very interesting, considering that the author, Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay for the first version!). While many people were upset that a classic was remade, I felt it was justified given the difference in technology available for film-making in regards to special effects, and the fact that the storyline is actually more authentic in the second version. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory also has Tim Burton's creative influence, which can be sometimes outside the box, but for the most part was laugh-out-loud funny and very entertaining."
9,"I saw this on Saturday. It's funny. I had a mix of feelings while watching this...

During the first part of the movie, where the golden tickets are being found and the characters are being developed, I was thinking ""This is SO good. I have to buy this on DVD when it comes out."" I loved the character development of all of the kids.

It has so many fun similarities with the original, but definitely some original stuff thrown it that is MUCH closer to the book (which I'm reading to my kids currently).

Anyway, the feeling changed when Willie Wonka enters the picture. Johnny Depp plays him incredibly well. Gene Wilder didn't play the person from the book. He played someone that is eccentric but really just ""a little weird"". Johnny Depp plays the character the way he was meant to be played. A major psycho with some definite issues.

The scene where you finally meet Willie is very odd. I won't spoil it for you, but you end up thinking ""That was really, really weird"". It sets the tone for the whole character...and you can't escape the fact that this guy is a total loon.

The story progresses fairly similarly to the Gene Wilder version and the similarities are very enjoyable...but so are the departures. You get a lot more background on Willie than the first movie and why he is the way he is. Another departure is Veruca's demise. In the first movie, she wants a goose that lays the golden chocolate egg. That's where she has her tantrum and loses it. In this version, there are no geese. Instead, as true to the book, there is a nut room with squirrels. The computer effects in this sequence are simply amazing as there is no way they could train squirrels to do what they do...and it looks totally real.

Another departure from the movie is the ending. Much better in my opinion.

In all, I will buy the DVD. I loved the movie and can't wait to see it again, but Willie Wonka is a really weird duck!"
9,"When I first heard a New Willy Wonka film was in the making, I must say I did hold a sliver of skepticism. How could it (the new film) compare to the original 1971 version? And then I began my research. Getting updates from internet sites. Reading my entertainment magazines, etc. I still had doubts! But what convinced me to change my mind? When I heard Tim Burton would be directing, I devoted my faith to him that his retelling of Willy Wonke would be great! And I must say it was! Early on, Burton said he was no ""remaking"" the 1971 version, to which is not a fan, but simply staying true to the book (which I have yet to read).

To simply compare the two films and say one is better than the other would be unfair. What I liked about one - I didn't not like about the other. Example: The 1971 version was full of beautifully extravagant set pieces, which one could tell took hours/day/weeks to create. Whereas the 2005 version was cluttered and diluted with too much CGI. Another example...Gene Wilder was very clever and quirky as Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp was brilliant, frightening, clever, quirky, funny, energetic, charismatic, charming...the list goes on! Furthermore, I must also admit, with th exception of the young man who played Charlie Bucket, the children in this film were much more dull, albeit meaner than in the 1971 Version. No to say this is a bad thing...I did much prefer the performances by the children in the 1971 version as opposed to the 2005 version.

And of course the story. Again, I have yet to read the book - however, I feel the telling Tim Burton gave the film was much more than a simple fairy tale of a possibly insane candy-man.

The 1971 Version was cluttered with obstacles, which prevented it from telling a truly ingenious story. Obstacles, such as the over-the-top Broadway musical numbers, did not move the story along. I was very happy to see Burton avoided such obstacles.

The overall moral of the story has not changed. However, in this telling, Charlie does more than simply gets the factory because he is a good boy. He also helps Willy Wonka rediscover the meaning of family.

On a scale from 1-10, I give this film a solid 9. I took away a point because of all the CGI.

Burton and Depp once again prove they are a force to be reckoned with. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory allows, no demands that you suspend your mind of anything but your imagination."
9,"I was always disappointed at the original Gene Wilder version of this movie - too childlike and junky, sugary sweet. Even as a seven year old I used to get really angry that this was NOT how I had interpreted the book - the imagery was so out of synch with my imagination. The book that Roald Dahl wrote was both amusing but had a sinister dark side that was never shown fully in that '70s movie. This new version is how I saw it - even all those years ago - slightly dark, sinister with that tongue-in-cheek humour that really describes Dahl.

The script 95% mirrors the book text word-for-word in parts and all scenes and chocolate bars have the correct name and look oh-so-close to the illustrations that are depicted in the first edition of the book, right down the the Art-Deco looking chocolate factory.

I loved it and could not get enough. Depp is hilarious as the semi-twisted Wonka. The Oompah-Loompah songs are a great modern take and use the correct lyrics again sourced from the book. Burton really took the time to get into this authors psyche and capture using images the essence of the text. Very cool. Oh yeah, read the book if you're 8-80."
9,"I will admit first off that I am a HUGE fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, but more importantly, Roald Dahl and his wonderful children's story. Thus, I lay in anxious anticipation for this film for over a year, and my biggest fear was that they would completely butcher the story, no matter how much faith I have in these cinematic geniuses.

HOWEVER, Burton and Depp and Dahl are obviously a trio of much creative power. Burton's penchant for fairy-tale stories with a quirky twist, Depp's eagerness to go out on a limb for unique characters, combined with Dahl's ingenious, age-old story make for one FANTASTIC movie.

The visuals in this movie, aside for some futuristic stuff like the television room, were on par with what the book intended, I thought, and inside the factory one is completely immersed in Wonka's wonderland. The only bad thing about the factory tour is that we didn't get to see enough of it - only enough for the story to make sense, although I really wish Burton had included some of the book's highlights such as ""Square Candies That Look Round."" Depp's acting was exactly the right kind of bizarre mystery that the role of Wonka required. Freddie Highmore, who plays Charlie, lived up to my hoped and is truly an amazing child actor. All of the children, parents, and other characters (most notably Deep Roy for his hilarious turn as the Oompa Loompas) were also highly amusing. The great story was accompanied by a fair bit of humour, humour that was insightful and often caught you off-guard.

The one major criticism I have of this movie is the addition of the Wonka back-story. To me, the fact that one didn't know about Wonka's past simply added to the mystery and excitement of the story. Although it fit in nicely with the film, I felt it took away from Charlie's story, which is after all the essence of the story.

Overall, though, this is a great movie. Mature kids will really enjoy it, and littler ones will like it for its great use of colour and joy.

Three thumbs up!"
9,"I loved this movie! It is as great as the original but for different reasons. The sets and special effects were fantastic. Right from the beginning, the mood is set. The visuals are dark, dreamy, and textured. Johnny Depp is amazing as Wonka. He is quirky, funny, crazy, and mischievous. I was literally laughing out loud during most of the scenes.

Gone are the wise Wonka quotes and Oompa Loompa songs that turned the original into a cult classic. Never the less, this movie is still a masterpiece. The soundtrack is hauntingly beautiful ?much like the music in Edward Scissorhands. Tim Burton is the perfect director for this new adaptation. He and Johnny Depp work their magic to make this a highly enjoyable movie to watch. It's Burton's best film since Edward Scissorhands. The acting is good. Freddy Highmore is sweet and charming as Charlie Bucket. But, Depp steals the show. I will definitely be buying the DVD when it becomes available.

Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is a must see movie for all Wonka fans."
9,"Just to clarify for those parents that will be bringing their child to see this movie....Johnny Depps character of Willie Wonka WAS NOT linked to Marilyn Manson at all!! This is a rumor that has been in many many magazines/web sites because people assumed he looked like the rock star. Knowing that Tim Burton does movies that portray ""interesting characters"" such as Nightmare before Christmas, Johnny does portray that kind of character.

Johnny Depp had admitted on his appearance on the Oprah Show last week that he wanted to do more movies that his own children can see. He made the Willie Wonka voice up while he was playing Barbies with his daughter and she liked that voice.

Just wanted to get the ""truth"" out there! Enjoy the movie!!!"
10,"So I have read an awful lot of negative comments about the new ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"". I myself have actually had the amazing chance to see a sneak preview of this movie in a contest and would like to put MY two cents worth in.

This is most definitely not a movie for young children with its hidden jokes and bizarre jumping about. A magical menagerie of color and wit with some very dark and eerie elements, this is a refreshing change from the very happy go lucky type movie that made up the original. While no one will ever be able to replace the truly amazing Gene Wilder as quirky chocolatier Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp adds new life and oddity to the character. The character of Charlie was wonderfully cast, using young Freddie Highmore to play him. The necessary chemistry required to make a movie actually work was extremely noticeable between Depp and Highmore because of their work together in the drama ""Finding Neverland"".

All in all I thought ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" was a wonderful movie but definitely not for the children."
10,"I was extremely pleased with the new Charlie and The Chocolate Factory movie, remake of the 70's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Tim Burton did an excellent job recreating the original lines and incorporating his own interpretation, which made this 2005's version exciting, comedic and entertaining. I loved the mix of characters that starred - some rookies and some vets - their roles were played magnificently. I was also very pleased with Johnny Depp's performance in relation to the original Willy Wonka. I arrived thinking his role was going to be like most every other role he's played, with his own attitude. But, it was totally different from what everyone was used to, and it was hilarious. I loved the mix of sarcasm and comedy. The audience was full of a mix of different ages and everyone was laughing and really getting into it. The end was one of the best parts because everyone thought it was going to end negatively, but of course they made it even better than the original. Everyone was on their feet and clapping for a job well done. Tim Burton, Johnny Depp - Bravo!"
10,"Story- The screenplay is closer to Dahl's original book, but it does more - This new version of Charlie and the Chocolate factory plays on a deeper level, as we learn more about Willy Wonka. This movie fills in the gaps of the 70's version and makes many things clear from start to finish. From that, what we get is a deeper story, which is what we all want in a movie. That's what makes this so good. It doesn't end so abruptly like the first movie did. We all know that Charlie wins the chocolate factory but by the end of the movie, the real winner is Willy Wonka himself.

Acting- Perhaps its the charisma and great acting of Johnny Depp that makes it so incredible. He does a great job in every frame with his facial expressions. I also liked the new Charlie Bucket by Freddie Highmore; he brings a special innocence to the screen. Its nice to have Charlie's dad in the movie, as he was in the book. Grandpa Joe is very cheesy esp. when they find the golden ticket, but what do you expect? A lot of the characters are cheesy because we know the story, and know what's going to happen, so the writers and actors just have fun with that. The 4 other children are very similar to the old movie which works perfectly. And I laughed out loud every time the Oompa Loompas started to sing, cause we all know they are going to and the new songs are so cheesy.

Visuals- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory boasts visuals and special effects from scenes in the book that the original movie could not do. The nut room which was in the book, was in this movie. Fudge Mountain was shown, and much more CG images that Dahl envisioned. Even the opening credits are fun to watch. With more visuals, more can be shown and thus explained. Its visuals and story work hand in hand.

Overall - Go see this movie. If you appreciate a good movie that makes you think and somewhat cry, you will enjoy this. I generally dislike Tim Burton's work, but this is an exception I think anyone will like. I believe this movie was better than the first and am sure you will agree too."
10,"If you have been a Burton and Depp fan since Edward Scissorhands, you will find their interpretation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory to be a tasty treat. The sets, the costumes, Depp's performance as the phobic Wonka, go beyond eye candy. A real feast! And Elfman's soundtrack manages to extract some of the most embarrassing tunes from the 1960s (ones that we wished would have remained buried in the deepest recesses of our memories) to add an equally memorable and entertaining audio experience. Freddie Highmore once again delivers a performance that makes us wish he will never grow up, as all young actors do. So grab your Wonka bars and golden tickets and head out to the theater. This is one movie you really should see on the big screen."
10,"I saw the movie on IMAX through a radio station. I was optimistic about going because the theater was far away, But after it was over I was glad I went. The movie was in my opinion better than the original. Tim Burton directing it made the movie good, but Johnny Depp made it even better. The movie was also great because it followed the book more than the Willi Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The Characters and Factory made it seem very much like a Rohl Doll which is why this one is a fun, wacky, and hilarious movie. If you see this movie I bet you'll be laughing the whole time. The timing of the movie was also nice because the movie was almost exactly 2 hours with previews an the beginnings of the credits."
10,"Roald Dahl's delightful book of the same title gets a magical production by that wizard of wizards, Tim Burton. If ever was a man who was born to undertake the adaptation of this beloved book into a film it was Mr. Burton, a man who understands how to entertain an audience with a good story and great cinematic flair.

Mr. Burton is lucky, as this film marks the fourth collaboration between him and its star, Johnny Depp. Both director and star are well attuned into what each expects from the other. The film is a triumph of creativity with a film that will satisfy children of all ages as well as grown ups. The screen play by John August serves the book and the film well.

Mr. Burton has given the film a glossy look that is absolutely impossible to be distracted at any given moment. In fact, the time flew by without realizing the movie was over, leaving us craving for more.

Willie Wonka, the genial chocolate maker, decides to invite five children for a tour of his famous chocolate factory. From the five that win the privilege, Charlie Bucket, the poor child with a rich family life, in spite of their poverty, is the only one we realize is going to be the winner because the other four display the worst qualities that will surely clash with their host. Charlie, the humble child shows Willie that having a loving family is a treasure that the chocolate maker hasn't got.

To say that Johnny Depp is magnificent, is not saying anything at all. As Willie, Mr. Depp has a brilliant field day hosting the group, and us, through his world and his realm. Mr. Depp is an absolute delight to watch; he seems to do everything so naturally that he becomes the real Willie Wonka.

As Charlie, Freddie Highmore, who had already appeared with Mr. Depp in ""Neverland"", proves again he is a young actor that is easy to like because he seems to be a natural. As his grandfather, David Kelly, is also wonderful. Freddie's parents, Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter are good, and the supporting cast do an excellent job under the direction of Mr. Burton. Deep Roy, as Oompa Loompa deserves special mention as he is seen hundreds of times! Philipe Russelot, the cinematographer does wonders with his camera. The musical score is brilliant. The people behind the production technical part must be congratulated for giving the director their best into making this film, the joy it is.

Let the viewer beware he is in for a magical ride thanks to Mr. Burton."
10,"A brilliant and imaginative reinvention of a classic tale- Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (like the title) stays a lot more true to Roald Dahl's original source material and makes for a wonderfully wild and entertaining time. Growing up as a youngin- I felt deeply connected to Roald Dahl's imaginative and vibrant stories; having written such books a James and the Giant Peach, Fantastic Mr. Fox, The Witches, Matilda and so many more- but no book ever meant more to me than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. When I saw the original film, wide-eyed and excited after reading the book a handful of times already, I felt an immense amount of disappointment and boredom. The original film's acting is dreadful, lacking of a consistent tone, broad and incredibly thin pacing, and all together just a very structurally unsound film. Thus I turned my child eyes to the work of Tim Burton with this film and immediately fell in love. It's such a beautiful adaptation from the source material, giving us the same songs used in the book, and staying incredibly accurate to the storytelling- with a few additions of course for the films runtime. All the films additions though, I really did enjoy, and provided a lot more heart to not only the film but also the character of Willy Wonka in general. The performances are all rather good, not a huge fan of the child actor playing Mike Teavee, but everyone else was perfectly cast and fun to watch- especially Johnny Depp's oddball character performance as the iconic character. The look and tone of the film exudes more of a dark energy, but I feel adds a lot to the wonder and whimsicalness of the story at hand. In the end, it may be an unpopular opinion, but I loved this film and would prefer it any day to the original adaptation."
10,"I thought this movie was very enjoyable and well worth the admission. Unlike some, I did not read the stupid book and do not plan on doing so. Additionally, I do not identify myself as some Wonka devotee and I am sure glad that ginning up Wonka centric criticisms is not my sole reason to live. I must admit I am personally anguishing over the fact that, unlike others, I opted out of performing some pointless comparative analysis between - book ? 1971 movie - and the most recent production. The end-result of wasting one's time regurgitating some of these condemnations will simply result in high-blood-pressure, chemical imbalances and soiled diapers. OK ? now wait. Once this personal anguish subsides, I will be able to continue ? ahhhh ? it's over, I can now continue. This movie easily stands on its own merits. Similar to most Burton/Depp ventures, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", will definitely have a number of followers (which I am a member). To some, it will become a classic. Whenever these two dynamic personalities get together, they seem to always stir up some magical tasty potion of entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed Mr. Depp's portrayal of a bumbling, snippy Willie Wonka. His sarcastic and (apparent) clueless delivery was superb. I doubt anyone else could have pulled off this part so brilliantly. I was also pleased to see him evolve away from the very successful 'Jack Sparrow' persona and highlight his acting diversity as Wonka. And once again, Tim Burton highlighted his behind-camera brilliance. Very much like Robert Wise of-old, anything Mr. Burton turns out, is usually worth gambling on. If you are looking for fun and original entertainment ? this is the movie for you. If you are looking for a remake, this is not it."
10,"Johnny Depp may be the most interesting actor of his generation, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" reaffirms that. The story of course has destitute Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) winning a trip to confectioner Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) factory. Probably the neatest aspect is how they've reworked Willy Wonka. Due to an overbearing, anti-candy dentist father (Christopher Lee), Willy has resulted a socially awkward wacko who looks like Jim Morrison and Tina Louise had an illegitimate son and occasionally utters aphorisms that may or may not appeal to everyone.

As for the other characters, the Oompa Loompas (Deep Roy) just love to sing about spoiled children getting their comeuppances, and Charlie's grandfather Joe (David Kelly) makes an interesting counterbalance to the young cast. My favorite scene? Gee, that's a tough one. I guess that any one of the other children getting their comeuppances made for something cool: the perpetually obese Augustus Gloop gets sucked into a pipe, the overachieving Violet Beauregarde turns into a blueberry, the spoiled-beyond-repair Veruca Salt gets thrown down a garbage chute by a bunch of squirrels, and the video game-obsessed Mike Teavee gets transferred into a TV.

Anyway, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is one movie that's bound to please everyone. Tim Burton really knows how to handle this sort of material."
10,"As i frequently watched one of the most loved Ronald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie (2005 version), and I would love to give my honest and loving opinion about this wondrous, never seen anything like this before film with the famous and talented Johnny Depp. This movie is full of Burtions imagination and talent to make Ronald Daul's ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" come to life with the amazing cast, this Adventure, Comedy, and family film that tells the story of A young boy wins a tour through the most magnificent chocolate factory in the world, led by the world's most unusual candy maker.

This film takes place in Munich, Germany, in a poor village. The main characters are Willy Wonka, Charlie Bucket, Grandpa Joe, Mrs. Bucket, Mrs. Beauregarde, Mr. Salt and Dr.Wanka. The story of this film is When Willy Wonka decides to let five children into his chocolate factory, he decides to release five golden tickets in five separate chocolate bars, causing complete mayhem. The tickets start to be found, with the fifth going to a very special boy, called Charlie Bucket. With his Grandpa, Charlie joins the rest of the children to experience the most amazing factory ever. But not everything goes to plan within the factory.

Where to start with the cast......Johnny Depp did Phenomenal as Willy Wonka. And some Tim Burton films Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter are in his films. Freddie Highmore did amazing playing Charlie Bucket, Johnny Depp suggested Freddie Highmore to play Charlie, which Depp has an eye for young talent in other people, and that's why I respect him. He gives young people chances to show their talent.. However, how they casted David Kelly as grandpa Joe was wise, because he bombed and did amazing in that role. Helena Bonham Carter always gets into the role so fast you can't believe who she is 100% of the time. Lastly oh my goodness how they casted Dr.Wanka..... Christopher Lee...Love that guy. Lee's Acting changes the whole atmosphere of the film.

Things that I loved about the movie where Johnny Depp played a Mad hatter like role, but took to another whole level of acting. Johnny Depp has acted over 35 years. I think this movie gave him so much more talent in his career. Some movies make the actor/Actress have better experience or talent. I think this film is what made Depp more famous. I didn't like how they casted the boy, he just didn't have the spirit of the other, and love for acting as the other actor/Actress did.

The lessons I learned from this amazing film are to take care of your family is more important than anything.The best things in life are worth waiting for and be grateful for the important and simple things in life, don't focus on what you want, focus on what lies ahead of you, and if you dream it, you can make it happen. Nothing is impossible. What I think others will learn from this heartfelt family film is that one thing in the world you should be looking for is if you can dream it, you can make it happen, nothing is impossible, and lastly always look for the thing your not looking for because it might be in front of your face, and you don't know it.

The group of people that would be interested in this film is Johnny Depp films, weird movies or a movie about dreaming and having that dream come true. I would recommend this movie 100% because it really hit me hard when I watched it because I started dreaming big and some of my dreams came true, and I don't focus on the bad in the world, I tried to focus on the good. The rating is PG. My final word on this film is watch it, think about, and spread what the movie message is. It is good because I have a high respect for Johnny and Tim's work. So I'm not surprised by how good Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is.

I Give ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" 5 stars out of 5 stars.

Film review: This film really touches on the subject of taking care of loved ones, and the love for chocolate. Hollywood lacks films like this anymore because movies like this one i believe that some parts depp was not acting at all, he was really feeling the emotions of the character. The love for Ronald Daul's stories over 77 years, hollywood has made films based on his books like the BFG, Witches, Fantastic Mr.Fox, Chitty Bang Bang, the movie business has always done an amazing job, but with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory they really make the story come alive with JOhnny Depp's role as Willy Wonka. Depp made me feel that he really was the character of Willy Wonka, and as the kids go through his factory. They get tempted to eat his candy, gum, and his crazy ideas in the factory, and the one thing they show in this film isc kids don't follow directions, only the smart ones or like Charlie with is grandpa, which had knowledge of the factory because he worked in the chocolate factory for s long time. I have never seen a film with different kinds of acting and costumes, and fun music. Another reason i have so high respect for this film and DEpp, he accepted the part as Willy Wonka without reading the script first, that's talent, and art in acting that is not in movies anymore.

10,"Is it just me, or do Tim Burton and Johnny Depp just go well together? Their first collaboration was ""Edward Scissorhands"" and amazed audiences in the early nineties. They teamed up again in 1999 to make ""Sleepy Hallow."" Again they made a wonderful movie. They have come together again to make ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" and I think that audiences will be pleasantly surprised with this movie. A Quasi-remake of the old 1971 film ""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory"" staring Gene Wilder, the newer ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"" goes in a very different direction mainly with the character of Willy Wonka. The stock characters of the various children that enter the factory with Charlie stay relatively the same. Mike ""T.V."" changes partially to a video game wiz-kid Violate is turned into an overconfident bratty martial artist, but they are still the same basic character. Even Charlie and his Grandfather stay mostly the same.

While I have not read the book ""Charlie and the Chocolate factory"", from what I have heard, the newer version follows the book more closely than the original film, and this can be partially given credit for the changes.

Those of you who thought that the original ""Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory"" was ""creepy"", I would encourage you to try this movie out if only on DVD or VHS. Tim Burton brings a new outlook to the Oompa Loompa's and as such changes the feel of this film significantly.

For any Tim Burton fan this is another must see. If you aren't sure then I would say to trust Tim Burton and his artistic take on things. With such hits like ""The Nightmare before Christmas"", ""Beetle Juice"", and ""Big Fish"" you can trust that his directing will keep you captivated for a few days after you see the movie."
10,"Simply put, Charlie and.. has done the unthinkable. They have taken a remake that easily overshadows the original. The teasers do no justice to the movie. Excellent acting by all involved. I was never a fan of Tim Burton. However, he gets better as he goes along. So I am now a fan. One can see that Burton had total control of this one. As for Depp, I have always been a fan. Ever since seeing Fear and.. When I saw the teasers, I thought that he was a fool for going with this movie. I even made a derogatory comment on this site based upon this teaser. I was wrong. The people in the theatre clapped at the end. So did I. It's a good one."
10,"Charlie and the Chocolate factory is an excellent classic story about Willy Wonka's chocolate factory and a boy who has to goes against five kids to get the ultimate prize (though this boy isn't really competing, he is simply enjoying the chocolate factory tour Willy Wonka has been guiding him on). If you say that you don't want to see it because you have already seen the musical I would like you to know that this movie is probably better because Tim Burton has made Roald Dahl's characters more real and it is easier to get this story than the other one because it gives better definition of the characters. Throughout the movie Willy Wonka has flashbacks of his childhood making this eccentric character more real (I won't tell you what the flashbacks contain for it would ruin the story but they really give better definition of Willy Wonka). The new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an excellent movie that I think everyone who loved the musical would enjoy as well."
10,"That's my one word review. One of the best and one of the most well written, directed and made movies I have seen in a long time. First one in a long while to exceed my expectations. I will probably see it again (at least) once just to catch anything I might have missed the first time. But on to the details.....

The 1971 movie that was based on this book still remains one of my all time favorite films. But no matter what people tell you, this is definitely not a mere remake. This is a re-telling of the classic children's book that was my absolute favorite as a child. And it is very faithful to the source material, down to most of the dialogue. Yes, there are some updates (good ones, to the four bratty kids and a subplot that was not in the book where we find out who Wonka is and why he got so zany), but beyond that, it's one of the better adapatations of a book I have seen on film.

From the opening credits with Danny Elfman's amazing score, you can tell that this is going to be a visual treat, with a very well done (although mostly CGI, but it's good CGI) opening sequence of the process of making Wonka bars that is classic Tim Burton. But fear not: This is not just ""eye candy""; the characters are well acted, the story unfolds at the right pace, and the entire movie is very entertaining.

We are treated to some background on Willy Wonka, get to know Charlie and the Bucket family (the part of Charlie is well acted) and the other four children who win the Golden Tickets. This part alone is entertaining enough, but then we get to the factory and the fireworks really start.

I admit, I was skeptical of Johnny Depp in the role of Wonka when I first heard about it. But he nails it. I was not at any time reminded of Michael Jackson, but rather of a bizarre cross between a Mike Myers character (only with a lot more substance), a Monty-Pythonish character, and I'm not sure what. But his wackiness is one of the things that really make the film; at the packed house I saw this at, he got most of the laughs (one of the Grandmothers and the other kids, particularly Veruca, got some as well). His performance is very different from Gene Wilder's, but equally entertaining.

The factory is visually amazing, and features everything from a chocolate river rapids ride to a room full of pink sheep to a room full of squirrels that are very sensitive about their nuts to heavy metal Oompa Loompas. I won't give too much away, but the kids meeting their fates for misbehaving are nicely updated and extremely well done-and more faithful to the book than the 1971 adaptation. The Oompa Loompas are great, their songs are very entertaining, and the one guy who played them all did a good job.

The ending is also great.....one of the biggest laughs came from the final shot of the film.

All in all, it was a very entertaining film, with off the wall humor (and a few double entendres that the adults will get but the kids won't), amazing visuals, and good storytelling. I almost gave it a 9 rather than a 10 only because some of the scenes in the trailer and in the commercials for some reason were edited out (none of the best ones, but some little things, for example, the ""don't lick my boat"" bit, the ""back off, you little freaks!"" and the line about ""dear old fish, go boil your head"" and a few other things, but they don't take anything away from the movie and will more than likely show up on the DVD. It's too good of a film to give anything less than a 10, and perfect family entertainment."
10,Excellent performance from Johnny Depp. It is a great movie to watch!
10,the first one away. I took my family to a 12:01 a.m. showing on opening day and found this movie to be absolutely worth the wait. Now I'm left waitng for this masterpiece to come out on DVD so I can watch it over and over. This movie is so well casted from Willie Wonka and Charlie right down to Veruca Salt it couldn't go wrong and the cinematography was incredible. I read it wasn't for children(I don't know what ages they are talking about) but my 10 year old laugh through the whole thing and loved it more than any of us which is saying a lot because I thought it was nothing short of a ten. The whole movie theater was into the movie from laughing to applauding and I didn't hear one person give a rating lower than a 9.5.
10,"I was always a huge fan of Dahl's book and had read it many times before seeing the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" The original film left me disappointed, mainly because Wilder's Wonka wasn't how the book had portrayed him, and the added scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe sneaking a drink of the lifting stuff made Charlie out to be sort of a ""bad"" kid for an instant. This movie, however, has gotten the book onto film almost perfectly. The sets, costumes, characters are absolutely breathtaking-- they're all insanely colorful and unique and entirely Tim Burton's style. Johnny Depp played Willy Wonka very well. I won't get into specifics, but the approach he took with the character was less of Wilder's ""father figure"" and more of a brilliant and eccentric, yet somewhat callous, inventor. This movie will captivate audiences from the very beginning. I only wish Roald Dahl was still alive to see a movie that does justice to his classic book."
10,"Tim Burton does it again. Along with Johnny Depp as the star and Danny Elfman creating the music, I don't think they could of found a better trio to make this movie anything less than great. I took my kids to see this movie at a sneak preview and they loved it. Johnny Depp is an excellent Willie Wonka, and gives it a great twist to the character. Johnny Depp has the ability to create a character that fits the roll. If you have seen Freddie Highmore in Finding Neverland, he was the best choice to play Charlie. Each character was well chosen and the humor is great. The script also gives wonder background to who Willie Wonka was before he became the eccentric later on in life. This is way better than the original. So if you watch it will be for pure enjoyment, taking you back to the simplicity of childhood, but with the complexity to remain true to the original book."
10,"This movie surprisingly has many comparisons to candy.It's sweet, delightful, and rich in taste.Johnny Depp also does a marvelous job as Willy Wonka himself.There's nothing that parents will have to worry about this movie.It'll make a fine and delicious treat that the whole family will devour over and over again.It's also better than the original, in my opinion.But Johnny Depp isn't the only big star in the movie.The movie itself wouldn't be as candy-coated as it is today without the performance of Freddie Highmore( August Rush), who plays Charlie Bucket.Trust me when I say that you will be in for 115 minutes of pure and delightful fun.This is one movie that even chocolate can't top."
10,"I have seen this movie, and I must say that this movie is FAR better that Gene Wilder's film. He was just right for 1971, but he seemed relatively boring. My sister, Colette, says ""nothing beats the Original"". I beg to differ with her. She was born in 1964, and I was born in 1980. Of course she would like the original. While it is true that I was born closer to Gene Wilder's film, I love Johnny Depp's film much better. I cannot wait until it comes out on DVD, and I am talking about its release already. If someone asked my opinion about whose film was better, I would say Johnny Depp. He is by far better than Wilder. I read a comment on a website from Wilder about Johnny Depp's film, and he was angry, and disappointed. He said:"" Why would anyone remake Willy Wonka? It's all about money"". I'm so sorry, but Gene Wilder has to lighten up. Johnny Depp's performance of Willy Wonka is extremely well done, and he and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", gets 10 stars, and two thumbs up from me. The new film far surpasses that than Wilder's."
10,"From what I had heard, I was skeptic at first, but when I saw this movie I couldn't stop laughing! Even now I will say a line from it and others will join in. I was originally upset that there were no green haired orange skinned people running around, but Deep Roy did a great job. I do not recommend bringing a young child to the movie, as it is frightening to many. But 6 up I have found really enjoy the film and adults love it! There are a lot of references to other (older) movies, plays, etc. I was one of the few teenagers that actually understood almost all of the humor in it! Johnny Depp is magnificent in his role, playing it perfectly! He plays the role of a man with the mind of a boy, just like Wonka should be played. I loved the original, but unfortunately for those Gene Wilder fans out there, I prefer the new movie. Just because you have heard it is twisted (which is true and which makes it even funnier) and you shouldn't bring your kids, it is still a movie just the parents can go see one night. If you don't go to compare it to the original, I just bet you will get your laughs and smiles. Maybe you will even consider seeing it again."
10,"I had been on the edge with this. I was scared it would ruin the original one, but it didn't, mainly because this was not a remake, but a different movie. And it was a very good one too.

The movie has comedy for all ages. Kids, teens, & adults can all laugh. But what makes this movie stand out above the rest is that it takes everyone on a chocolate trip that you can't resist. In fact, by the end of the movie, my mind was so crazed with chocolate that I went to the concession stand and bought two bars of candy right away and munched it down.

The song of the Ommpa-loompas do not match the original, however they are very funny and very good.

Depp performance is very good because he's able to perfectly act as the real villain of the whole movie without you knowing it until the very end. All along the movie you think Wonka is the hero, but in the end you realize that Wonka is actually the main villain of the movie. Depp does a brilliant job in ""hiding"" this fact.

Now, I do like the 1970 movie better than this, but I think that is mainly due to the songs. Everything else in this movie was far better.

8 / 10. very good movie, one you should definitely go to see in the theaters, and IMAX if you can. If you're an adult, bring a child with you. If you're a teen, bring some friends. Anyone can enjoy this movie, which is probably the main reason why its amazing."
10,"I saw this last weekend because ""The Island"" wasn't playing at four. I was blown away! I was looking forward to seeing ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" but did not think that it would be this good! I have seen the original and have never really enjoyed it very much, ""Charlie"" held my attention from beginning to end. Tim Burton creates a wonderful world of imagination, color, and magic.

I've heard a lot of people say that they didn't like it because Johnny Depp ""Act's like Michal Jackson"" Well, if you have read ANYTHING Johnny Depp has said about this you will know that he did NOT base Willi Wonka's Character on Jackson. I personally thought he was funny (as did everyone else in the theater I was in) and the back story that Tim Burton and John August have added to his character explain why he acts so... different.

This is a wonderful movie, and one of my personal favorites."
10,"As someone who is a fan of classic TV and movies, it's still surprising to me that this is my favorite movie. A wonderful performance by all the cast, and especially Johnny Depp. It's still hard for me to wrap my mind around the fact that it's him. Thoroughly enjoy this movie every time I watch it."
10,"I went to the first showing of this film yesterday, and I have to admit, I was in no way disappointed! Burton has most certainly done an excellent job in remaking this classic, giving it a more modern flare. His slightly creepy humor gives this movie the impeccable taste that was so appeasing in Edward Scissorhands and Sleepy Hollow.

Jonny Depp does an excellent performance as the slightly demented, but lovable, Willy Wonka. He proves, once again, that he is able to take any role, and portray it with the ease, and believability that many people crave for in movies in this day and age.

The children discovered for this movie were perfect. They all had wonderful personalities, and never left the viewer board. The boy casted for Charlie was WONDERFUL. He was the absolute perfect part! All in all, I believe Tim Burton has done it again, another wonderful movie with many laughs, and a good lesson too. I'm ready to add it to my DVD collection, as soon as it comes out!"
10,"I love most of Tim Burton's films. I think this is by far best one of his greatest. It brings out Tim's creativity and a lot of great humor. Johnny Depp gives a new life to Willie. He was magnificent. A must see movie. Great for kids. I like the hidden adult humor. We all need that if we take our kids to the movies. I would recommend this film to everyone. I love this movie and would see it over and over again. I am a Johnny Depp fan, and he well deserved this role. I am looking forward to seeing The Corpse Bride. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp are a great combination. Together they bring a new meaning to movies. I think anyone that sees this movie will want to see it again as I know I do."
10,"I did not read the book or see the ""other"" movie, so I was not swayed by either. I found this movie wonderful in every way. Performances by Johnny and Freddie were superb. Don't try to compare the movie or the characters to others and you will find it a delightful film. The movie stays true to the book except for the father and his profession. It is always wonderful to see Christopher Lee though. This movie is yet another great collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The only bad reviews I have heard are from people who insist on comparing this movie with another. Freddie Highmore is a delightful actor and I hope to see him in more movies to come. He plays the part so sweetly. Johnny Depp, well his performance is wonderfully wicked as usual. I found this movie very delightful and magical."
10,"I think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a wonderful ride. It was very colorful, nice graphics, music (Elfman) and excellent characters. I like the old and new Willy Wonka but in this version...it appears they could do much more and better things (ex: Wonkavator and the boat ride). I think Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did their own version of Wonka in their unique way. The updated Oompa Loompas(sp?) music was pretty neat as well, the songs were each different which was nice. I got tired of the Original Oompa song in the first movie so this was refreshing. I really was pretty sure that Tim Burton wouldn't mess this up and I believe he didn't. A well executed wonderful approach to this classic!"
10,"Tim Burton is back in town with 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', a delightful new adaptation of the classic Road Dahl book. It's got everything you'd expect from a Tim Burton movie: Danny Elfman score, bizarre humor, wonderful production design, and another weird performance from Burton favorite Johnny Depp. Depp is Willy Wonka in one of the most original performances of the year.

Everyone knows the plot: Little Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is one of five kids who get to visit Willy Wonka's amazing chocolate factory. Charlie is a good boy, but the other four children are selfish and greedy. At the end of the day, four children have been punished, and Charlie is rewarded.

Johnny Depp is one of the best actors working today, and his strange performance as Willy Wonka proves it. His Wonka is germophobic, utters 60's catchphrases, and doesn't like parents. Truth be told, it's a better performance than Gene Wilder. The added subplot about Wonka's childhood and his stern dentist father (Christopher Lee) adds some interest, and it doesn't slow things down. Freddie Highmore, who was last seen with Depp in 'Finding Neverland', is great as Charlie, and I can't think of anyone else in the role. Special mention must also go to David Kelly, who infuses Charlie's Grandpa Joe with charm and enthusiasm.

The production is a beautiful one, and it showcases Burton's affinity for the bizarre. The special effects are impressive, too, and they're not bogged down with too much CGI. Danny Elfman's score is his best in years, and I found myself more than once humming along to the theme.

It is said that Roald Dahl hated the original 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'. However, were he alive today, I think he would have liked this wonderful adaptation. It got the seal of approval from his family, after all. 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is a terrific film."
10,"This movie far exceeded any expectations I had about it. Since it's been a while since I read the book, I don't know how closely it follows, but it was laughter left and right. Johnny Depp's portrayal of chocolateer Willy Wonka was one of his best performances to date, his voice, his expressions, his general stature just added to the movie. Freddie Highmore was spot on as Charlie, and Christopher Lee was wonderful as Willy's dentist father. Christopher Lee is just meant to play the more evil characters. Deep Roy was hilarious in his role as the Oompa Loompas, who I love more than the other ones. Burton's use of flashback was also quite wonderful, and something deeply missed in the original.

The camera work in this was highly entertaining, and the set was just amazing. The colours used provided more than enough visual stimulant, and really brought out the characters.

However, when Willy and the gang were in the glass elevator (visiting the burn center and the like), I almost thought for a moment that I was watching Hitchhikers Guide again! It was like the planet workroom scene in H2G2.

All in all, this movie is definitely worth the money spent, and should be seen over and over again. I guarantee almost constant laughs."
10,"I saw this film on the 21st of July with a friend who felt the the songs were awful and that Johnny Depp's performance was irritating. I'll agree with her on the Oompa Loompa songs despite my love for Deep Roy and Danny Elfman, however I feel differently about her opinion on Johnny Depps performance. I thought it was great! I mean I can understand if people are put off by his resemblance to MJ(which I only see in pictures and not in the movie) and his drawing from Mr rogers and the like. But his performance was original, and that the point. If it was closer to Gene wilder's performance than there wouldn't have been anything for anybody to mull over. He sticks in your mind, and he's great for the kids. In regards to the whole Christopher lee thing, I love him and I thought the subplot was nice at first but the ending was forgettable to me. they should have focused on Wonka's inability to trust after having his secrets stolen from him. oh well...

other than that I love the cinematography, art direction, costume design, score and the make-up! Tim Burton is a wonderful visionary!"
10,"I've just sat and read through the posts concerning both movies, that in itself has been highly entertaining! :)

I loved the book as a kid... was thrilled as a kid when they came out with the movie. I hated the original movie. I remember feeling so let down after watching it.

Watching Burton's version last night was an evening of complete fun! My husband and son and I laughed throughout, I thought Depp was brilliant. The theater was 3/4 full... and the laughter and enjoyment rang throughout place.

There are going to people who won't like it (""weird"" as Depp/Wonka would say), people who are going to nitpick (""mumblers! I can't hear you!"") and people who feel the need to compare. Okay... sorry for your luck.

I, however, would like to walk up to Burton and Depp and give them a big hug and a thank you for the laughter and the fun they gave us last night. Brilliant as always, boys!"
10,"I thought this movie was excellent and definitely a lot better then the original. I give it 10 out of 10 stars, Two Thumbs Way Up! Finally they made an updated version of it with more sophisticated technology.

Everything in this movie is great, acting, costumes, production, script, directing, following of the book and many good lessons. Lessons in this movie include: being greedy is foolish, if you're spoiled and a brat no one will like you, it's disgusting to chew things all day long, there's other things to do besides watch t.v. and if you're nice and sweet good things will come your way.

The things I like in this movie were the Chocolate Room, Nut Room, Glass Elevator, etc.

Johnny Depp, also did a great and a lot better job then Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka!"
10,"Charlie And The Chocolate Factory will be labeled and looked at as (what most movie fans fear) a remake. However it's not. It's not even close to the original which starred Gene Wilder and is one of my top 100 favorite films of all time. Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory was so far off form the book which was written by Rohl Dahl that Dahl (Who was rumored to detest the original) refused to sign off for a sequel. If Dahl was alive today he would have been very happy with Burton's version. It is practically word for word, scene for scene just like the book of the same name. The plot is simple. Willy Wonka is a candy god. The world worships him. Then for reasons which I will not explain because that would spoil the movie for you he closes his candy factory forever. Then out of the clear blue he decides that he is not only going to open the doors again but he is going to allow five lucky children to tour his factory, something that has never been allowed before. He runs this contest by putting five golden tickets in his Wonka Bars. The five lucky kids are Augustis Gloop a heavy kid from Germany who lives, breathes, and sleeps for chocolate. Tehn we have Violet Borogard. A little girl from Atlanta Georgia who's motto is winning is everything. She hates finishing any place but the top. Then we have Veruca Salt. A spoiled little rich girl from Birmingham, England. She has a father who's opinion on the world is money can buy everything. There's also Mike Tevee who's life revolves video games. He's a snot nosed punk who will stop at nothing to insult, cut down, or humiliate anyone in his path. Then finally we have Charlie Bucket. A bright little boy who has the heart of gold. He lives in a shack with his parents and his four grandparents. They barely have any money to put food on the table. Charlie is extremely tight with his Grandpa Joe. Who fascinates Charlie with his stories of Willy Wonka. Charlie is the one child who wants this prize more than anybody and deserves it because unlike all the other spoiled brats in the film Charlie is a working class blue collar kid who you just can't help but feel bad for. After the tickets are found the children meet the man who is their hero. Willy Wonka himself played by Tin Burton alumni Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, Sleepy Hollow, and the upcoming animated Burton film The Corpse Bride)who holds his own as Mr. Wonka. Milly is nothing what these kids think he's going to be. He's rude, brash, and a complete wise ass. In one scene when Violet throws her arms around him and says ""I'm Violet Borogard"" Wonka looks down at her with an uncomfortable expression and replies ""I don't care"". The chocolate factory is a child's imagination come to life and no one has an eye for eye candy the way Tim Burton does. If you've never seen a Burton film then check out Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, or The Nightmare Before Christmas and you'll see what I mean. This movie has restored my faith in Burton when ""remaking"" a classic (although as i said before this film is not a remake) but I'm a Burton junkie and have loved all his movies, yes even Planet of the Apes (yes I'm the one). After the debacle that was Planet Of The Apes (2000) it looked like Burton's career was over. The movie was a bomb and loathed by most fans that saw it basically giving a lot of heat about the ending (although P.O.T.A. has a better ending than the recent War Of The Worlds remake I've been told)but Burton bounced back with the masterpiece Big Fish. He hasn't dropped the ball since. Charlie And The Chocolate Factory is one of Tim Burton's best films and has great eye candy as well as laugh's with Depp's Wonka and the Oompa Loompa's (all played by one man who's been CGI'd to make millions of Oompa Loompa's) and the songs in the films are funny as hell. As for Depp, he hold's his own as Willy Wonka. Believe me he has some big shoes to fill from Gene Wilder's Wonka. However as I said before this movie is so different from the original it falls into the apples and oranges category. It's hard to compare which one is better. The original is still a great film that I will always love. Burton's version ranks right up there with it. Burton's version is almost scene for scene, word for word just like the book. The original is not even close. Which is why I can't even compare the two as well as tell you who was the better Willy Wonka. Again apples and oranges. If you want a good time at the movies where you can just leave your brain at the door and get lost in a weird, wonderful world then i highly recommend Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. Burton fans will love it. It ranks up there with Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks, Beetle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Big Fish. Even people that have never seen a Burton film (Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetle Juice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks, Sleepy Hollow, Planet Of The Apes, Big Fish and the upcoming Corpse Bride) will have a tough time not enjoying Charlie And The Chocolate Factory. It's a great time at the movies. Heck you'll find yourself wanting to go by candy as soon as the credits begin to roll. On a scale of 10 I give Charlie And The Chocolate Factory a 10. Go and enjoy. You won't regret it."
10,"This movie is fantastic. It's directed by the brilliant Tim Burton and stars the hottest of hot Johnny Depp! It's a funny, crazy, weird (in a good sense) and even moving story that will make you want to watch it again and again. I myself have seen it 5 times! It is all about Willy Wonka and his truly awesome factory full of the coolest creations! (And little funny people!) I easily give this full marks. I love Willy Wonka as he has flashbacks and when he does his sad look you want to hug him. He also knows how to dance! Anyway my point is, is that this movie is fantastic and I don't think it matters if you are; young, old, weird, twisted, sick, funny, outcast, reject, mutated or afraid or small people (like myself) you will love this film and find something in it that moves you in a certain way. Of course small children may find Johnny Depp some what disturbing but they just don't understand the meaning of ""hot"" yet. So enjoy watching folks, your in for a weird and wacky (did I just say wacky?) journey."
10,"Once again the partnership between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have successfully made a brilliant film. Personally i have never really like the musical version of the Roald Dahl book and was looking forward to see how Tim Burton had really got to the dark side of Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp like always gives a tremendous performance as Willy Wonka, he was funny and dark at the right times which gave extra depth to the character. Like many of the Tim Burton films there was a quirky element throughout eg, making the Bukett house look like it was slopping so there for everything seemed to be on a tilt. he also (which i have to praise him about) got rid of the hideous white/orange/brown Oompa Loompas and brought in the wonderful Deep Roy, who did a good job by playing all of the factory workers. Overall i think this film was excellent and recommend that everyone should see it even if they didn't like the book or don't like the actors i assure you that you will be leaving the cinema or switching the television of and wanting chocolate!"
10,"I must say that when I first saw the preview for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I was QUITE skeptical. As one of my friends mentioned ""It looked like it was being weird for the sake of being weird."" However, I saw the movie last night and BOY was I wrong! It was nothing short of INCREDIBLE!!! Fans of the book will NOT be disappointed with Tim Burton's delightfully unique adaptation and fans of the original movie will not feel as though they've already sat through it before. To my surprise it was a completely different feel from the Gene Wilder version. It was, as are many Tim Burton films, like you were in a completely different world. The sets were superb and there was definitely a note of magic in the movie. The acting was nothing short of amazing. Johnny Depp is truly one of the most versatile and talented actors I have ever seen. He never reuses a persona but gives each one their own flare. He is positively eccentric (and hysterical) as Willy Wonka. Freddie Highmore is as cute as can be and easily lovable (as well as pitied) as the lucky Charlie Bucket. The other children are marvelous! I loved the little girl who played Violet! I also loved how they brought Mike TeeVee up to date (an obvious change due to advancements in technology!) Also, the chemistry between the whole of the Bucket family is astounding! All in all a deliciously good movie with tons of laughs and fun!!! Adults and children alike can enjoy it, beginning to end! So, if you want a night out with your friends, or family, don't hesitate to go straight to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory!"
10,"Well.I've heard so many bad remarks about this movie.so I'm gunna say what i think. I've had the pleasure of reading the book and the displeasure of seeing the original. In my opinion this version totally out does the crappy Gene wilder version. the oompalompas actually all look alike,their not any freakish colors,there's no creepy tunnel scene.and not nearly as much singing *thank god* singing is OK but to much is a bad thing.and the songs they do have in this version are much much better.

This movie also tells things that the original doesn't.i mean jeez. It explains why willy is such a recluse,why he has no family.explains what happens after they get into the elevator.the original...it was like all that happens is they get in the elevator and thats that. I find this movie one of Burtons Best films yet. also compared to the last movie...this one is way more heartfelt.in my opinion anyways.... and plus johnny depp is a much better actor then gene wilder."
10,"I watched this movie today, thinking that it was going to be pretty good, truer to the book, well acted, nice visuals, thinking that I had set my expectations too high, and guess what: It filled all my expectations!!! This movie is so true to the book, and is jet fresh and new.

Me being a big fan of Rhoald Dhal and his book, I always thought that the Gene Wilder version was a little bit too detached from the great book version. I prefer this movie over 71 movie.

Don't get me wrong! I really, really like the movie with Gene Wilder (a role he did great), but I love this movie.

So, even if you're very fond of the old one, try watching this movie with a fresh mind, and if you're a fan of Rhoald Dhal, this movie is all you ever wished for.

That's also why I believed this is (hopefully) the last version of this. There's a rumor of a sequel, (Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator) which I hope they will make and I will definitely watch.

Johnny Depp gives us a great Wonka, Freddie Highmore is just the one as Charlie.

The parents, grandma's and grandpa's all do it great.

All the kids really are great, especially Jordan Fry as Mike Teevee. Julia Winter is more 'spoiled' instead of 'bratty' than Julie Dawn Cole in the first version. Philip Wiegratz is just it as Augustus Gloop, and finally Annasophia Robb does it amazingly well as the always winning chewer.

The oompa loompa's are alway's fun. The music fit's every moment and has this such great visuals.

This movie is a must see, even if you liked the older version. I did, and I still do."
10,"First I will say that I have been awaiting this film eagerly for a long long time. I have always thought that Willy Wonka was one of literature's best characters. He's a genius, he's crazy, and he's oh so intriguing. I love the book as well as the 1971 classic film. However it should be known that the book and '71 film were written by the same Roald Dahl and are obviously intended to be different from one another. This film IS NOT a remake but in fact an adaption of the novel as imagined by Tim Burton. Those who know Burton's works can probably guess that this film is just as awe inspiring as a triple shot of LSD. Burton achieves a gorgeous and stylized treat that will keep your eyes glued to the screen even if you hate the movie. As for staying true to the story they stick to the book with surprising accuracy except for several key parts. Willy Wonka as portrayed by Johnny Depp is an eccentric and slightly frightening candy maker who is haunted by an unhappy childhood as shown in a series of flash-backs. These scenes add significant elements to the film that fleshes out Wonka more than ever and alters the ending slightly. The children are all portrayed by talented actors and actresses who do all but add horns and wings to the children to make them as detestable as possible, making their demises satisfying rather than disturbing. A fresh new twist on the oompa looma chants deviates from the well known chants of the '71 film but uses lyrics found in the book. I found Charlie Bucket portrayed by Freddie Highmore to be far less irritating than Peter Ostrum's portrayal of the boy in 71. As for Mr. Willy Wonka. He is far more upbeat with a much wilder disposition and wit with a much more fleshed out character who seems to have been affected by the 20 years of isolation through his lack of social graces and crazy nature. It's wild, fun, and pretty. Depp is incomparable and Burton's vision is brilliant. All of this topped off with much more humor and a superb score make this the family movie of the year. As for which film is better, they cannot be compared they are two uniquely different but equally superb films. Those who enjoy a light musical and a more laid back film should stick to the 1971 version. Those with a love for the odd or who want a more faithful adaption should see this one. Everyone should see this one if for no other reason than it's beauty. I LOVE WILLY WONKA!!"
10,"For everyone who loves Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) and is worried that seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) will be a waste of time, I would like to offer the following suggestion: You Could Not Be More Wrong!! I have been excited about the prospect of a new version of an old favorite for some time now, but still entered the theater with some skepticism. I left with nothing but a smile and wishing I had not waited until the very last show of the day so that I could have gone right back in and watched it again. This film further convinces me that Depp and Burton are somehow matched on a mystic or cosmic level. No two other people could have pulled off what they did. So much more of the original book was explored and such wonderful surprises pop out around every corner. From the troublesome children to the oompa-loompas you will recognize characters but in a way you've never seen them. Some scenes are as enchanting as ever (like the first room they enter) and others are brand new and utterly fantastic. For children who this is all new for to adults who can't believe a newer version could keep up with, let alone top, an original all I can say is it's magic!!"
10,"This re-make is nothing short of genius! the original will always remain a classic. and Tim Burtons version is certainly destined to be historic. Special effects, story line, characters, music scenes, actors, and especially the oompa-loompa were perfect! This movie was my 4 year old son's first non-cartoon movie and he kept his attention on the screen during the whole movie. I will take my kids to see the movie again and I'll buy the DVD the second it hits the streets.

Johnny Depp is the perfect Willy Wonka this time around and the Squirrel scene is worth the price of the movie ticket alone.

This version. is pure fantasy. and its what all movies. should be made of."
10,"In 1994 I read Roald Dahls classic tale about a boy named Charlie Bucket and the realization of his wildest dreams.

Roald Dahls book, Charlie & The Chocolate Factory was supposedly made into a major motion picture years ago, starring Gene Wilder as the eccentric and borderline physcotic Willy Wonka. Wilders version was considered a classic by many, including myself... until now!

Wilders version is noticeably weak when stood against this true ADAPTATION (not remake) of Dahls epic tale. Augusts screenplay was pure unmitigated genius, backed up by Burtons strong directing that accurately reflects the tone of the book. And lest we forget the ace ensemble which is also noticeably stronger than the rather mediocre performances of the lesser version. Most of all Depp is excellent at playing a Wonka that is truly as intended by Dahl (a child trapped in a man's body, not a reasonably mature tap dancer) Unlike the Wilder film, CATCF's darkness is complementary to the story, rather than seeming out of place.

Once I was forced to tolerate what seemed like a hasty movie version of a classic book, and now I am able to fully enjoy a true adaptation with a rational ending and a fine effort. This deserves to hold the place as the true tale of Charlie Bucket and Willy Wonka, not the so called ""original."""
10,"Now let me tell you, I am not to big a fan of the original. I think most of the songs are annoying, but acting is good. When I heard Burton (one of the best directors of our time) and Depp (BEST actor of our time) were going to do this, I was excited. Then the commercials came, and I was even more excited. I went into this and wasn't disappointed. I'm not kidding, I laughed so hard, the only times I wasn't laughing was when I was listening to the lines delivered by Depp. Depp gives an awesome performance. It is just what the books meant him to be, crazy. He very much reminded me of Mr. Rodgers. All the kids were great. The directing is awesome. How could you expect less of him? The sets and everything is magical you just get absorbed into this movie, and you believe everything he tells you. Now to the music. I was worried when I heard the Oompa Loompas sing, but when I heard it was based off Dahl's lyrics, I wasn't worried. They were hilarious and the Loompas were great. This has some interesting new things to it also, like the back story of Wonka. I say if you see one comedy this year. See this, it sure kicks Bewitched's ass."
10,"This version of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" intrigued me the first time I heard about it, with Tim Burton at the helm and Johnny Depp as Wonka. It also made me go back and reread the beloved book by Roald Dahl, and then, as I thought about Depp as Wonka, I was a slight bit worried about it. I didn't want Depp's Wonka to be *too* weird.

However, the movie is excellent, and though Johnny Depp does of course portray Wonka as quite weird, it's perfect, and has hilarious results. Freddie Highmore as Charlie is also just right: caring, loyal, imaginative, and unselfish to a high degree. There was hardly a moment when I found myself comparing this film to the Gene Wilder version, and when I did compare the two, it was never unfavorably, just remarking on how different the two versions are. Danny Elfman's score is also perfect, with the Oompa-Loompas' songs and the main title theme.

I think Tim Burton was absolutely correct in stating that his version of ""Chocolate Factory"" is a whole different take than Gene Wilder's ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"": it's not a remake, it's actually truer to the book. (Not saying that either version is better than the other.) I think kids will love the wondrous scenery of the factory and the brattiness of the other four kids. But if you're not a kid, you can still wholeheartedly enjoy this funny, fantastic, and totally entertaining movie."
10,"I absolutely loved this movie. It has reminded me why the original film was so special. Even though the original will always be a classic, in some ways, I almost think that this movie surpassed the original. For example, it actually showed more than the original film. In the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", it is only mentioned how the Oompa Loompas came to work in the factory. But in ""Charlie"", you actually see Wonka go to their home country and find out why they are even working for him. Another interesting thing about this movie is that we get to see into the life of a young Willy Wonka when he was just a child; he has been emotionally scarred by his strict father who never allowed him to eat chocolate or any other candy because his dad was a dentist.

The scenery for this film is amazing. From the snow covered city, to the candy room in the factory, it was very beautiful and set the perfect mood for the story. Tim Burton in a recent interview said that it is real chocolate that you see coming down the waterfall, no fake stuff. All in all, it is very wonderful eye candy.

As my brother, who was with me mentioned, it was amazing how well the young actors in this film did. Very talented and eerily resembling the actors who were in the original film. The person who was Charlie in the film did an excellent job, and so did the person who played his grandfather. Johnny Depp is the perfect choice for Wonka. Wonka comes off as a big kid and Depp played it brilliantly. He is just what you see on the TV commercials, a very cool character that made the movie even more interesting.

The music was very catchy, with each new person that was eliminated from the contest; the Oompa Loompas changed the music entirely for each one. These songs had me tapping my toes at many parts, it has inspired me to go out and buy the soundtrack. And the classical scores by Danny Elfman were fantastic as well, he is sure to be the next John Williams. His music help set the mood during the opening credits when the chocolate bars are shown being made.

Overall, this film is everything I had hoped it would be. This has become my favorite Burton film. The entire time, I can't remember when a smile wasn't literally on my face; it was just like being a kid again watching the original for the first time, even though in some ways the stories are completely different. This is probably the funniest time I've had in the theater so far this summer, and I have seen Episode III and Batman earlier this season. On a pure enjoyment factor, this movie is tops. What's not to like? It's a feel good movie that touches the inner child in us and leaves you feeling good by the end. If you miss this movie, you are missing something huge."
10,"I am so incredibly impressed with the team that made this film. They all did an amazing job. Johnny Depp was a brilliant choice for Wonka, as he has proved time & time again that he can do anything. Even his flops were....well, not THAT bad anyway. I loved all the new things that were added, but having grown up watching WIlly Wonka, and now having had 3 kids that are growing up watching it ( and they love it as much as I) I noticed all the things that were not there from the first movie. Not a problem for me.

Shame on Gene Wilder for complaining that this film was being made. Deprive the world a new & wonderful story that has the benefits of all the technology that has come our way..since what? 1971, was it? Look at all the films that have been remade..Oceans 11 & Amytiville Horror just to name a couple. And the TV shows from back in the day being made into full length films? That list goes on & on. What's the problem Gene? K, said what I came to say..THANX!"
10,"I usually wouldn't write a review for a movie that already has so many but I have decided to come forward and defend this one, particularly since a lot of the negative reviewers sound like they have descended into hysterics. I really don't understand what all the caterwauling is about. You would have thought that Tim Burton produced a film advocating Satanism for children or something. It's really not that serious and people need to get a grip. To be clear I have seen both the original older rendition and this one and I HAVE ENJOYED BOTH. It's a DIFFERENT movie and I find the acting therein SUPERB. I have watched this film many times and the jokes, facial expression and banter never get old. The cast did an outstanding job. I find myself laughing EACH and EVERY time I watch this. As far parental advisories I watch this with my children all the time. (Admittedly there about perhaps TWO scenes that may be very briefly disturbing.) And I am big on parental guidance when it comes to movies and I am quick to protect my little ones and quick to protest, yes PROTEST, when Hollyweird gets out of line. But I really don't see what the fuss is about. (But of course, it is clearly for each parent to decide.) For those who insist on comparing this film to the original and posting your protestations online please calm down. Know that you are doing the public a diservice with your hysterics. Please step aside and allow others to view this film for its own merits. For those who have an open mind go forth and enjoy this. You won't be disappointed!"
10,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a great summer film. I was reluctant to see this at first, but my friends persuaded me to see it. I was not disappointed. Charlie lives with a poor family in a shack. Nothing good ever happens to that family. But one day, Charlie finds money and he brought a chocolate bar. He found a golden ticket inside. He and 4 other children are brought to Wonka's factory where there many unusual things happen. This film is one of the better films on my list. The acting was tremendously good. I never thought that Johnny Depp could play Wonka as well as Gene Wilder in the original. Burton did a good job directing this film. Danny Elfman did a great job composing a momentous score. This film is for all ages, but little children might find this movie a little scary. I rate this film a 10/10."
10,"This movie is pure imagination all over again for Wonka fans and anyone else! First of all, yes, it is like the book, yes, it is different than the 1971 version, yes, there is no doubt Tim Burton directed this movie, and no, Johnny Depp didn't remind me of Michael Jackson (maybe because I wasn't obsessed with following Mr. Jackson's trial like everybody else).

This timeless children's classic is extremely faithful to Roald Dahl's quirky world, while appealing to a whole new generation of kids and families. And who better to create a quirky world than the master of quirkiness, Tim Burton. Much like Hitchcock's famous cameos, there are plenty of Burton-like images all throughout the film (including a brief image of Wonka holding a pair of scissors that reminds us of another Burton-Depp collaboration). The visuals are absolutely stunning, so stunning that you could almost watch the movie with the sound down and still be entertained.

The acting is all first rate. Johnny Depp's originality never ceases to amaze me. And Freddie Highmore is wonderful as usual (if you haven't seen his performance in Finding Neverland, see it). The nasty kids do a good job of mixing reality with their broad characters, and their equally nasty parents are the same. Once again, the classic book is appropriately brought into our modern life while sticking to the timeless quality of the story. Most notably are the Beauregarde's, hilariously brought to life by Missi Pyle and AnnaSophia Robb (quite the versatile little actress, for those who have seen Samantha and Because of Winn-Dixie). Here we have the pushy cheerleader mom who has created an obnoxious little clone of herself (know anyone like that?). And Mike Teavee is not only obsessed with television, but now, with video games (know any kids like that?). I cannot mention the entire cast, but everyone else did a terrific job, too.

Fans of the Gene Wilder version (and I am included in that list) will be pleasantly surprised (especially with the inclusion of such chapters as ""The Other Children Go Home"", a rather wickedly satisfying chapter, but I won't give anything away), and fans of the book (I am included in that list, too) will be pleased to see a movie that is as faithful to the book as you can get and have it still be a movie."
10,"Roald Dahl wrote countless of books, many of which I grew up reading in secondary school. There are many of his works adapted for the screen as well (The Witches, Matilda), but none so far given the Tim Burton treatment.

The opening credits/scene has Burton's fingerprints all over - the imaginative sequence, the Gothic soundtrack (done by long time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman), mammoth weird looking architecture and snow filled landscapes.

In the beginning, we are brought to the small world of Charlie Bucket, whose family find difficulty in making ends meet. As Wonka announces the 5 Golden Tickets (for a special visit to his factory) hidden in his chocolate bars, we are introduced to the backgrounds of the other children's family and stereotypical character, like the German glutton, the English brat, the American go-getter, and the Television (Wonka accused of mumbling) boy. And no doubt, the audience will definitely root for the time when Charlie actually gets his ticket and join the rest.

Willy Wonka is the number one Chocolateer, but he certainly has issues relating to people, and I guess nobody can blame him after having his ""Secret Recipe"" hijacked by corporate espionage. We are told of Wonka's background in a series of flashbacks throughout the plot, and one of my favourites is when he journeyed and stumbled upon the Oopma Loompas.

As the narrative gets predictable, it actually turned it into its advantage, as the audience expects to see some innovative room in its spectacular imaginative splendour, the set pieces in which the children get themselves into, and the performance of the little Oompa Loompa people, whose hilarious spontaneous song and dance routine will definitely leave you laughing out loud.

Towards the end, after the side-splitting zaniness of the factory excursion, the theme of Family is highlighted, and nicely wraps up the movie, both for Wonka and Charlie.

Johnny Depp is class, but really though, I thought his Willy Wonka actually adapted Michael Jackson's look and nuances. He managed to highlight Wonka's freakiness and child like nature to a T, and Depp has shown he has done no wrong with diverse roles in Tim Burton's visionary movies. Also remarkable is his recommendation of Freddie Highmore into the role of Charlie. If you'd remember, they worked together before in Finding Neverland, and their on screen chemistry was brought into this film as well. Many touching moments featuring Highmore will tug at your heartstrings, and I suppose besides Dakota Fanning, he's one of my favourite child actors of today.

I can't rave enough of the sets created for this film, with its wonderful use of colours. And besides scoring the film's soundtrack, Danny Elfman also provided the unique sounding voice of the Oompa Loompas, and purist of the book will be glad that the lyrics for most of their performances were from Dahl himself.

Although adapted from a children's book, this is one movie I'd recommend to adults as well. I guess Roald Dahl would have been proud of this effort! Bring out the Wonka bars!"
10,This isn't a remake of a movie. It is a second movie about the same book. Two very different things. The other movie is based upon Charlie. This movie is based upon Willy Wonka. Do not judge it by Willy Wonka and the Charlie Factory. Judge it as its own film. Roald Dahl's family participated in this film. As close to Roald Dahl himself participating as you can get. This is not the case for Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. There were Dahl's producing this film as well as going as far to write the lyrics to the songs. It is a film that is dark in a cinematographic way. Not emotionally dark or the such. It is a great film that mixes quotes from the past with the current technology. This is an awesome make of Roald Dahl's novel 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' for this generation. All those people who are claiming this movie is horrible are nothing more than those who are die-hard lovers of the film 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' and have no place in their hearts or minds to even consider this film anything other than a movie without Orange Oompa Loompas.
10,"All I can say is I LOVED THIS MOVIE! So true to the original book, but completely its own interpretation! I really think Johnny Depp did a terrific job making Willy Wonka his own character and Freddie Highmore is such a beautiful child, that you cannot help but root for Charlie from the beginning. The factory, the glass elevator, and the pink candy boat were exactly as my mind's eye saw them...almost 27 years ago when I first fell in love with the book.

This was a great feat, and thank you Tim Burton for making such a wonderful, wonder-filled film. The sets, the casting, the timing...impeccable, and to have the original lyrics of the oompah-loompah songs from the book was a great joy. I will never look at Willy Wonka without thinking of this wonderful experience, and it is the genius behind this film that made it so special. God bless you, Johnny Depp, Freddie Highmore, Danny Elfman and Tim Burton...you have made the little girl inside this 36 year old woman very happy indeed."
10,"I saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory on July 15 at 7 am. Personally, this movie has now became my absolute favorite. The reason may be because I base this movie off the book, not like the thousands who complain about the movie whom they base it off the Gene Wilder classic, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is not meant to be in any connection with Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory other than they used the same book as their guide. If someone would have asked me if Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka before seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, I would have said yes... but now, I have came to the conclusion, Gene Wilder was just a man who attempted the role of Wonka, while Depp, is indeed Willy."
10,"I absolutely loved this movie. I've heard a lot of people (who haven't even seen the new movie) talk about how Gene Wilder's version of Wonka is so much better. Let me tell you something. I own the first version of the movie and I love it, but the new version is great too. You have to be able to accept that it is going to be different. After all, it is more faithful to the book. There have also been many comments about Johnny Depp's character being ""creepy"" and Michael Jackson-like. You can't read that much into it. Depp is just portraying the fact that Wonka has been in that factory for 15 years, hasn't had much contact with the outside world, as has never grown up. I thought the film was great and I have already seen it twice; something I didn't plan on. Don't judge the movie and make comments about Depp's performance if you haven't seen it yet."
10,"I really didn't know what to expect with this movie but I had heard that some people didn't like it because they expected basically, a remastered Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I saw it with the attitude of not expecting it to be the original at all and I loved it! I have been a Tim Burton fan since I was six or seven years old and I have to say that there was not a thing in this movie that I disagreed with. I loved the make-up, the set, the acting, everything about it!The direction in this movie was groundbreaking and very original, even for a Tim Burton movie. This movie has definitely put itself in my top ten favorite movies of all times. Even though I thought it was so amazing, it is definitely one of those movies either you will love or you will hate. I loved it!!! Johnny Depp was exceptional as usual."
10,"Just go see the movie - the visual presentation cannot be put into words here.

Johnny Depp is brilliant as Wonka Christopher Lee is Superb as his father Helena Bohnam Carter - delicious as Charlie's mother Liz Smith as Grandma is sheer laughter (I like grapes) Charlie - the boy, the actor - such a wonderful child - you can see it in his eyes when he opens the golden ticket and then shows it to his family - pure magic.

Charlie's decision in the movie to not accept Wonka's offer because he cant' take his family with him is gorgeous to watch. A child growing up in poverty would never leave a family like that behind, he knew that they were his world, and to leave them for a life of loneliness is a life that would be lost.

Overall - a perfect version of the classic book. Not to compete with the original, but to go to levels that the original movie would not have been able to do given the time it was made and the technology behind it back then.

The scene stealing squirrels are fantastic. The only part I missed was the ""fuzzy lifting drink"" from the first movie, but in the end, it wasn't needed here, it would not have made sense with the purity of a child's love of family that is Charlie Bucket!"
10,"Great remake! I did like a movie-movie-book comparison, so I read Roald Dahl's book then watched the 71 version then the modern version. I found Gene Wilder's performance of Wonka to be too soft and not as crazy, wild, or childish as Dal's original portrayal. He acted too much like a father figure. Johnny Depp did much better as the crazy willy wonka we all know and love. The new one was much more accurate. The few things that were not accurate was wonka's physical appearance, in the book wonka had a long scruffy black beard, wonka's flashbacks were never included in the book and there was no fizzy floaty soda. Also, the umpa lumpas weren't dressed as little orange little men with green jumpers. Other than that it was a great movie worth buying!"
10,"I saw this movie just yesterday, and I was very impressed. Tim Burton's version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a feast for the eyes and the imagination.

As I watched the movie, I did not find myself comparing it to the 1971 version at all. This adaptation is not so much a remake as an entirely different interpretation of the story, and it is fascinating in its own right and for its own reasons. It is also remarkably faithful to Roald Dahl's book, and because I had read the book just before the movie came out, I found myself thinking, 'oh, that part's just like the book' or 'I remember that from the book' numerous times. In fact, many lines were taken directly from the book.

I will admit that when I saw the trailers I thought, 'Hm. . .Johnny Depp seems awfully weird in this movie. . .' and I was a little worried, but leave it to Johnny to think outside the box and come up with a brilliant performance as Wonka himself. Little Charlie Bucket was just perfect- I liked him a lot more than the Charlie in the other film. The rest of the Bucket family was much more likable than in the other film too. And the other four children, Augustus, Veruca, Violet and Mike, were all wonderfully portrayed. They represented perfectly all the bratty children that exist in this world. A unique approach was taken towards creating the Oompa-Loompas, them being just one person, digitally copied. The fact that they were all completely identical did not bother me at all (although this could be because the actor who played them was in The Neverending Story, my favourite movie), and did not make them any less interesting. However, I will admit that their songs were a bit bizarre, but the lyrics were taken straight from the book.

Every single second of the movie seems to have been thought out with great care and therefore the overall look of the film is very polished, as though no expense was spared to make the film look perfect. The only two things that bothered me were the fact that the setting of Charlie's home-town was not clear. I think it was supposed to be England, but I was not always sure. The other thing is the including of Willy Wonka's father and flashbacks of Willy's past. That was definitely not in the book and I was at a loss to understand why it was put in. Oh well, at least it didn't take away from the fun of the movie. Speaking of fun, I was laughing out loud in the theater. It was all just so amusing and clever and wonderful. Please, do see it. Don't let the weirdness bother you. There will be something to laugh over, I assure you."
10,"I really enjoyed this movie. The music was the best! Danny Elfman is a god, what else is there to say?

I told myself not to compare it to anything but just to watch so I did, and I walked out loving it.

Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is too funny for words. It was goofy and lovable. Overall the whole cast did a great job, but I was mostly impressed with the boy playing Mike Teavee. I hated that brat! He was more annoying than the old Mike Teavee. I wanted to reach through and strangle that little sucker. So I applaud that actor for really being Mike Teavee.

My money was not wasted, I would gladly spend more just to hear those songs and see those odd flashbacks again. I hope everyone sees this movie it will leave anyone in a good mood."
10,"I know a lot of people were upset when they heard that there was going to be another remake of the Willy Wonka movie. Well, i was excited and couldn't wait! And besides, it's NOT a remake! It's based off the book by Roald Dahl. And Tim Burton didn't even like the other Willy Wonka movie! This new Charlie is great. He did an exceptional job at portraying the ""Charlie Bucket"". But Johnny Depp was great too! I thought that was one of his best acting performances ever! Even though he was really creepy, he was good at being the psycho Willy Wonka. All the kids did a great job too! I thought that each had it's own type of greediness and nastiness. And most importantly, Tim Burton did a really good job at creating the atmosphere of the factory! OK, i loved this movie, and so did all my friends. If you have NOT seen it, see it right now! it's that good! (i saw it twice in two days)"
10,"I went to see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory this weekend with great expectations. All of my expectations were met and then some. The movie was delightful just like Willy Wonka's candy!! Johnny Depp did an amazing job as Willy Wonka. He was just so funny with his child like humor.

He made my children and I laugh from the moment he was first on screen. For those of you who want to know the difference from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory versus Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory I do have a few things to say. First, I watched Willy Wonka when I was a kid although I did like it and am still a fan of it today, I was always a bit scared during the film. Especially with that tunnel scene!! I was unsure if Tim Burton would bring some of that darkness to Charlie and the Chocolate factory, since he his known for making some dark films. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was dark in no way and is a great movie for all ages.

Secondly, I always thought Gene Wilder played a mean Willy Wonka up until the end when he offers Charlie the chocolate factory. Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka was just plain funny, as I have already mentioned. In my opinion there was no darkness in Willy Wonka with Johnny playing him. Which I loved and thought made the movie way more enjoyable!! On Charlie and the Chocolate Factory you will learn more about the story and the characters. Plus, you will get to see the Oompa Loompa's of today and their more modern songs. This movie is definitely a must see for everyone. I promise you will not be disappointed!! My kids and I loved it so much we saw it again yesterday. It was just as great the second time around."
10,"I love what Tim Burton does with the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I do not feel that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has done that version any injustice of any kind. This movie is full of laughs and it even has eerie qualities which are a large part of what makes the movie work so well. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka just seemed to be exactly what I was expecting. I was pleased with his makeup as well as the character's tone of voice and attitude.

I was also pleased with the various behaviors given to the children. They were all much more bratty than I had expected them to be and this only added to my sympathy toward Charlie...not to mention, it was amusing! I also liked how each child who won the golden ticket was shown before actually arriving to the factory. This gave me a chance to get to know them and their personal attitudes and this was hilarious to watch.

In a newspaper article, I read that people could somehow make a connection between Johnny Depp's character and Michael Jackson, and he as the actor could understand why people could make this connection. Aside from some resemblance and what seemed to be similar behavioral characteristics, I could honestly expect Michael Jackson's Neverland to be as strange and unique as Willy Wonka's chocolate factory!"
10,"In watching the 1971 version of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, you notice two things... A. Wonka is a very mysterious, but secretly mean man. B. You don't know why he is a mysterious and mean man.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(2005) I went into this movie thinking it would be an almost exact copy of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. I knew from other reviews that it would be very much like the book. To me, this movie fills in the holes that the old one left out. In this version, you find an understanding about the character of Wonka himself. You can see why he built the factory, why he won't trust grown ups, and also why Grandpa Joe seems to know so much about the factory. Depp brings a whole new man in. His character is wacky and strange, Wilder's character is funny and slick. THIS MOVIE IS NOT A REMAKE. It has a complete new story to tell.

Simply put, this movie will keep a smile on your face. The humor Depp brings to the film is absolutely wonderful. Fun to watch, fun to listen.... Wonka is very much alive and kickin now just as much as then!"
10,"I just got back from seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at a drive in Movie Theater. The entire movie was everything I anticipated it would be and more. Tim Burton puts a slight dark twist, but still manages to keep it to the storyline and to wow audiences of every age! The Chocolate room was magnificent! It was tasteful to your eyes. The cast was a perfect fit and the music was wonderful. I may be a little bias about it(since I live in Denver,CO-One of the lucky golden ticket winners was a resident of Denver, LOL). It warmed my heart from the beginning right to the end. I must say though that since the movie does not in fact have the original scene of 'the bubble room' I was a little disappointed(it's my favorite part of the original), but Burton makes up for it with all the other candy treats to the eyes. I would say this is a MUST SEE for people of all ages!"
10,"The adults and children alike in the theatre responded happily and vocally to this movie at the showing I attended with my daughter. The film is bright, well paced and the acting is excellent. Johnny Depp is a PERFECT Willie Wonka...another acting coup for him for sure. His outfit, hair style, wide smile,voice and gestures create a very sympathetic and likable character. He is really a great actor. The other adults and the children also seemed to relish their roles. The costumes were extremely appealing. The set at the chocolate factory colourful, bright and delightful. The musical tunes catchy and fun. The dancing was a treat. Even the hovel/little house where Charlie lives with his loving family ... parents and grandparents, is intriguing with all the tiny, interesting details. Tim Burton is a master of the usual yet appealing films. Good see this movie! You'll be happy you did!"
10,"Tim Burton did quite a lovely job with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I have to say, I think it was much better than ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" This one stuck more to the book, not completely though. Then again, have you ever seen a movie sticking 100% to the book they're based off of? The movie had me quite pleased. The cast was great fitting for each of their roles, the children were perfect for their parts, and acted out exactly how they were supposed to. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka impressed me. He was very cute, witty, funny, and dorky in a way. He really made the character of Willy Wonka come to life. It was quite different from any of his earlier roles. The movie was hilarious, it had many witty remarks. The Oompa Loompas are.. interesting to watch and are funny in their own way. Willy Wonka's sarcasm is sure to get at least a few laughs from you.This movie had the whole theater laughing. It's a movie that everyone would enjoy, no matter what age. This movie was entertaining and humorous. In addition, they have many references to other movies, which might be fun to try and catch while watching the movie. Well, what else can you expect from Tim Burton(gifted director who has made some of my favorite movies) and Johnny Depp(a talented/lovely actor) All in all, this might have been the best movie so far this year."
