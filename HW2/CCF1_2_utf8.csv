2,"Just like so many other remakes of great films, this is one that fails miserably on so many levels. First of all, Johnny Depp does not display near the wit nor the charisma that Gene Wlider did in the original. You actually see Willy Wonka before the big day arrives, which takes some of the mystery out of the character.

None of the characters are really enjoyable like in the first film. They seem to lack any real emotion or style. The special effects are overkill for the overtone of this story. It is almost like Walt Disney meets Timothy Leary. If you are a fan of the original, steer clear of this abomination."
2,"If you're looking for a remake of the original movie, you'll be greatly disappointed. I have no idea if it's closer to the book since I never read it, but I don't really care. Two of my friends were baked and they hated it also. Johnny Depp came no where near portraying this genuinely nutty recluse like Gene Wilder did, and the factory and oompaloompas did not have the magic, appeal or mystery of the original movie. And they removed one of the best scenes when charlie and his grandfather were floating from the fizzy lifting drink. The only really good scenes involved charlie's grandparents at home, they were really funny and I loved the one grandfather's comments about the other gold ticket winners. But in the end, i've never seen so many disappointed movie-goers.

If you really want to see it, save your 10 bucks and wait for the DVD."
2,"This movie version stunk! Yes, I know it was more to the book but having Johnny Depp??? Come on. Don't get me wrong, I do like Johnny Depp. He's had his share of good and bad movies but this another bad one (I don't think he can get any worse than Cry-Baby). Anyways, I do believe they could have done better for the role of Willy Wonka! Much better. You can really tell this was a Tim Burton movie. The coloring, the acting, and the sets. How about that house?? Seemed like one small touch to it and it would just fall like a deck of cards. How can Charlie really sleep with the roof open like that? (Yea, I know, it is a fantasy book) The Oompa Loompa scenes were terrible! It was interesting that the same guy played ALL of the Oompa Loompas but the dance scenes were just plain awful. Just another part which downgraded this movie. But back to the fact that he played ALL of the Oompa Loompas, would it have hurt to get more than ONE person to play the parts??!? At least in the Mel Stuart version, they got a bunch of them to play the parts and some of them couldn't speak English! OK, time for the good parts. Tough to do. I would give this movie an 8 for the special effects. The glass elevator for instance. Traveling throughout the factory and even through the town with rockets. Nice. So having the choice of the Mel Stuart version, which got away from the book a lot but good actors, or this new Tim Burton, which stuck to the book but bad choice of actors, I would still pick the Mel Stuart version in a second!! Sorry Roald Dahl!!"
2,"There is no way Tim Burton could make anything without some sicko slant to it (as here with a display parody of Disney's ""It's a Small, Small World"" display at Disney World melting with dolls seeming to bleed and becoming disfigured and ghoulish creatures to frighten children.

What was mild dis-ease in the original comes across as full-blown sickness in this Burton-ized bastardization. I don't know what trauma he suffered as a child, if any, but he seems hell-bent (literally) on inflicting it on other children with ""Corpse Brides"", making Halloween hellish and now this.

Don't allow this trash or anything else Tim Burton has anything to do with near your children. Period."
2,"All I can say that there can be no human alive who could possibly like this version over the original version with Gene Wilder. I actually liked the movie up until Johnny Depp appeared. From there on, it was terrible and I couldn't wait for the movie to be over. I don't know what Tim Burton/Johhny Depp were thinking. First, Willy Wonka shouldn't look like he is a 30 year old transvestite. Charlie's grandfather worked for Willy Wonka decades ago, so he should look somewhat middle aged. Next, Willy Wonka is supposed to be a genius. Johnny Depp plays him like a stupid eight year old kid. I don't believe for a second he is some kind of genius. Johnny Depp is neither a likable or funny character. He is just weird. Very few funny moments. Gene Wilder's performance, on the other hand, is fantastic. He captures oddness, with humor and intelligence. The Oompa Loompas songs were simply unbearable....just awful. The rest of the cast was actually good. All the children were pretty well played. I didn't like the parents much especially compared to the original version. Veruca's dad in the first movie was much more effective. Charlie and his family were well cast, especially Charlie.

All in all...very disappointing. It's a poor interpretation of the book and a disgrace compared to the first movie."
2,"Having watched this film in the cinema I can only say that it is a complete disappointment in comparison to the original one.

There are far too many unnecessary special affects. Apart from Johnny Depp the acting is terrible especially the girl that acts Veruca Salt, she sound as though well rehearsed without giving any personality to the character. The fact that all Ompa Lumpa are the same person really gets up your nerves and the songs are atrocious.

A very dim film, and having been a big fan of the book and the original film I can only say that it is a complete waste of time and money to see it."
2,"I'm sorry, but I totally missed the point of this film.. It seemed just like a slightly more sinister, CGI'ed rehash of the 1971 version... but all the charm taken out. There are very few deviations from the Mel Stuart script and what there is (Wonka's troubled childhood) doesn't hold much value.. Tim Burton seems to be holding back and not pursuing a clear vision with this film. Someone commented that thankfully the psychedelic boat ride had been taken out..? What?? That scene blew my mind as a kid.. way scarier than anything Tim Burton has managed to pull off.. The Umpa-Lumpas are CGI banality personified.. they are copy and paste versions of the same person scaled down to a 3rd normal height in Photoshop.. no character or humour, just stupid. Their songs were a rubbishy trip-hop flavour without any of the original's quirkiness ..and within the context of Tim Burton's otherwise song-less film, just pointless. Like the entire movie really."
2,"Witness me as I take this solemn vow: I hereby swear not to take my children to a theater and expose them to brainless pointless heartless bastardized rehashments of things I once held dear and loved, and have passes on to them in its original form to love as I have thus lining the pockets of talentless filmmakers and the Hollywood crap factories they work for thus promoting the demand for more of said substandard and unnecessary remakes.

Well Well Well. Not much to be said that hasn't been said already. First of all, Tim Burton Hasn't made a good movie since Ed Wood in 1994, and I don't foresee him ever returning to his original form. The preview for ""Corpse Bride"" that accompanies Wonka just proves that. It promises to be just a rehashing of The nightmare before Christmas. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie did have promise, especially David Kelly's performance as grandpa Joe. I know everyone will be comparing this movie more to the 1971 original adaptation rather than the book, but I cant help it. The Original was timeless, this version is extremely dated (note the hip-hopped up versions of the oompa loompa songs) the Wolper film might have strayed from the novel by adding in new songs and removing Charlie's father (Dahl himself suggested this), but it didn't invent and entire subplot such as Wonka's estranged father. The film is like someones dissertation of the story, attempting to dissect the character and explain his origins, something Dahl would have never done. The film was poorly directed, relying heavily on CGI effects. As pretty as they were they did nothing to enhance the story. When I first saw Augustus, I couldn't decide weather HE was a CGI effect or an actual actor. In fact, all the kids in this movie have a sort of eerie ""plastinated"" effect, they don't look human, Like they stepped out of the Mutter museum. My biggest problem came from Johnny Depps performance. He may be slightly more true to the character in the novel, But Gene Wilder definitely played the part better. Wilder's Wonka was subtle, sardonic, romantic, evoking Shakespeare, Keats, and Oscar Wilde. Depp appears to be on dope. If Burton wanted a wonka that sounded and acted like Dave Foley from the Kids in the Hall, he should have cast he became totally obnoxious after only a few minutes on screen, and from then on it was almost painful to watch. Sad. what do you expect? This is by far the worst summer for ""movies"" in my memory. Is is any mystery why attendance is dropping off in theaters? when 7 out of 10 movies are remakes and 10 out of 10 are terrible, why not save 50 bucks and head to the video store. May I suggest David Wolper's 1971 classic ""willy wonka and the chocolate factory"" starring the incomperable Gene Wilder in the title role? your welcome."
2,"Saw the premiere. Waste of time. Burton will prob do much better with corpse bride. It is along the lines of a nightmare before Christmas. but about Charlie. Depp was typical Depp. Burton was typical Burton. The story, however, was told better the first time WITH music. don't give me the story how this is not a remake, but a more accurate to the book telling. Who cares?? There are much worse movies that vary from the book that should have been re-made long before this one. At many points I found myself waiting for one of the famous lines or songs only to see this film try hard not to be the first film. I hope the dahl family enjoys their more accurate junk. I feel bad for all the families that will get sucked into seeing this garbage with the whole family. At todays rates....ouch!! Just buy a copy of the old movie, microwave some popcorn, and sing along with the family instead. Sleepy Hollow and Scissorhands it ain't."
2,"this has to be one of the worst movies i have seen this year (maybe ever). it seems that lately johnny depp has been exploring his feminine side (see 'pirates') but this is ridiculous! 'willy' could have easily passed for 'wilma'. it was a terrible 'take' on this character. the movie just wasn't funny. i didn't laugh once. i could hear the audience's fake chuckling during all of the 'gee, they meant this to be funny so i better laugh' parts. it was sad. the flashbacks to willy's upbringing were idiotic and added nothing to the story. it was what it was - filler. i could go on and on about this stinker but i won't due to time constraints. the saddest thing about this mess was the total disregard for the main idea in the book (and the first movie). that willy was in search of a child pure of heart to run his company. remember slugworth offering a reward for any 'gob stopper' that the children would give him (against willy's orders)? then charlie gives the gob stopper back to willy instead of slugworth, giving up untold riches - and proving he was honest and had the utmost integrity. it was the best part of the book and it still brings a tear to my eye. the new movie doesn't even touch upon this all-so-important life lesson. that honesty and integrity bring the biggest riches. but i will give credit where credit is due, and there was one thing i did like about the movie. the final credits - as this was the sign that i could finally leave the theater."
2,"Once again, we are subjected to greed and self promotion as another classic gets copied by today's filmmakers who shamelessly abandon creativity.

First of all, let me get this off my massive chest. Yes, it is a REMAKE. The original was made in 1971. The arguments about the changing of the title or that it is closer to the book have no merit. It is a COPY of the 1971 classic with the SAME characters and basic storyline.

Johnny Depp's performance falls so far short of Gene Wilder's and this is obvious to everyone. Wilder's wild, eccentric, poetic, unpredictable style was superior to Depp's reclusive, socially-moronic, mumbling, flashbacking attempt. Speaking of flashbacking, was that really necessary? Christopher Lee is a fantastic actor but this is wasted on one of today's ideas of having to pick through the origin of some of the best misunderstood characters in entertainment. Why oh why do people feel the need to go back in time to see Darth Vader, the Grinch, and now Wonka's child highlights when leaving it all alone is much more mysterious?

The kids......2005 Charlie looks like an imp with over sized ears. Whenever I look at him I just can't get by those bat-wings! 2005 Verucca, though cute and talented, was nowhere near as bratty as the original. Making 2005 Mike Teevee a video game freak was to be in touch with the times, the original Mike was still superior. The original Violet was more obnoxious which equals better. This new one with the win-at-all-costs mentality falls short.

The CG-generated Oompa Loompas were a lame joke. Mass producing that goofy looking filipino was totally lame. Though their songs were taken from the book, I thought the Augustus one was OK but I remain faithful to the original Loompa songs which were far superior, humorous and ingenious. I also remain faithful to the original 1971 movie which filled me with magic and adventure as a child.

I also remain faithful to the original in terms of grading. 2005, made for the ignorant who missed the first one, is a failure. 2 out of 10 stars."
2,"The original Gene Wilder film is superb and original. A classic of its time, we have a saying in England ""if it ain't broke don't fix it"". Johnny Depp who is a brilliant actor gave me the creeps in this new version, I did not feel comfortable with my young children watching such a weird character. The props and sets are better than the original, but so they should be. Gene Wilder in the original film came across as an eccentric recluse, which was fine. This Tim Burton version went back into Willy Wonkers childhood, which I found confirmed the weirdness of the Willy Wonker/Johnny Depp part. The magic and charm of the original film, its script and story line should have been left along with the now carbon copied Oopa Loompa's."
2,"I went into this movie wanting to like it, but after about 30 minutes I could see it was another Tim Burton-fest devoid of heart. The sets looked like Batman/Beetle Juice makeovers and overall the movie was FLAT FLAT FLAT. Burton is all about the visual and minor things like acting and story are secondary, to say nothing about his lack of understatement, which would more intimately involve the viewer.

Mostly, there's no >sweetness< in any of his recent movies.

I think there once might have been, but it's been lost somehow. The teaming with Depp and Elfman just isn't working for me anymore. Gene Wilder runs rings around Depp with his slightly-crazed/funny and yet touching portrayal of Willy Wonka. I don't really know why I'm writing this, but Burton has missed the point again."
2,"First off let me say I am a huge fan of the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. In 1st grade my teacher read the class the book. What made the first movie such a masterpiece was Gene Wilder's excellent performance. His version of Willy was smart, witty, extravagant, and clever. The whole movie was filled with extraordinary things that Wonka had something clever to say about. The classic also taught a moral lesson and showed what happened to spoiled, gluttonous, and TV addicted kids. The reason why I despised the remake is this; Willy Wonka was not any of the things listed above, he was insane and rude. He was just making rude comments to the children the whole movie and saying things that made no sense. Another thing that bothered me is that every time the words 'parents' or 'family' is mentioned Johnny Depp looks like he is going to vomit! The story is not about a candy maker's relationship with his father, it is about a fantasy candy land! I did not go into the theater expecting the remake to be better then the original but I was hoping for it to be good since it had Tim Burton directing it and Johnny Depp playing the role of Willy Wonka. Most remakes take away things from the original and add different things. In the case of this movie it was exactly like the original only missing the cleverness, the excellent music and dance scenes, good acting, a wonderful main character, and originality. On a scale form 1   10 if the original is 8, the remake scores a 2. I would suggest not seeing it."
2,"My mom and I walked out on this movie. I love comedies like There's Something about Mary, the Mask, etc. I liked Pirates of the Caribbean, too. I generally like Johnny Depp. Though this movie was occasionally slightly humorous, it mostly just dragged and was creepy. It pales in comparison to the original. A young kid behind us was crying because one part was so freaky. I wouldn't recommend taking young children to this movie. Besides, most of the few funny parts were adult humor (not sexual or anything bad, but just too mature for children). I rate this movie a 2 out of 10. It tried to be really clever, but I wasn't impressed."
2,I am so glad that we did not take the children to see this film. The opening scene of the children going to the factory for the prize of seeing the factory was a little unsettling. The children with the adult walked into the factory to meet Mr. Wonka. The puppets started to sing and move around after a while they moved around the puppets burst into flames then the puppet's eyeball melted out of its head. That was the beginning of 1 out of 6 very weird things not for the under 10 crowd. Mr Wonka seemed to have at first emotional problems relating to family that worked out later but did not need to be addressed in a child's film. Every time that he tried to say the word Father or family he acted like he was going to throw up. My younger children who love the other film would not be able to understand this adult concept nor should they have a reason to.
2,"This is a movie to be forgotten, don't even think of seeing it. It is a disgraceful remake of one of this centuries best movies. The changes and deletions from the original detract so painfully that no present day special effects and fancy ideas can mend it. Depp, you sure made a mistake taking this part. Freddie Highmore, I wish a great future, charming on screen presence. When will Director's and Producers of today actually realise that there back-room thinking never comes to fruition on the big screen. If you want to endeavor this one right, you simply start with Gene Wilder and Peter Ostrum and bring the Wonka Factory into the Present Day, you simply cannot go wrong."
2,"I was very disappointed in the movie. Johnny Depp was more like a demented robot than a real character. The children's characters were not complete and poor imitations of their 1971 predecessors'. This is one of the times when less would have been more, even for Tim Burton it was too flamboyant. The oompa-loom-pa had very little character and seemed mean and nasty. The squirrel thing seemed more like a rip off of the ice-age popularity. Thankfully the original film is on DVD as I am sure this will be soon. I did like the Grandpa Joe character. All the characters were played from an evil point of view and where was Slugworth?"
2,"Was it just me or did Johnny Depp sound exactly like Michael Jackson? Even the billboard I saw after viewing the movie reminded me of the MJ look. I've always been a Johnny Depp fan, but I can't give him high marks for this one. The film had highlights of added humor and far more flashbacks than the life of Charlie. Wonka is depicted as a lunatic and the film lacks a good moral story. The humor in some scenes revolves around immoral acts such as Charlie's father stealing caps from the toothpaste factory.

Slugworth didn't lurk around each golden ticket winner, so there wasn't any temptation for the children to be deceptive. Instead the film revealed that all of the children were ""rotten"". This area of the film perturbed me. There was no character building, learning from mistakes, or any scruples to to this wonka story except, ""you won Charlie because you were the least rotten kid""

The classic songs were replaced with either flashbacks or humorous antics such as the grampa dancing like the Six Flags Commercials.

As the children enter the factory there was this somewhat amusing set up with singing toy dolls, yet it self-destructs and the toys catch on fire. You could literally see the dolls melt and eyeballs sliding off! Once that happened, it was not amusing but sick. Willy wonka was right there behind them, ready to pull out his cue cards to begin the explanation of his factory, you would think he would know what to say, but for some reason his role in this film was to be the look alike MJ insane guy, with a horrible father who would not allow him to eat chocolate. As far as I could tell that was the only reason he ran away from home.

Gene Wilder from the original was not insane, but funny, goofy, playful, and serious when it came to someone stealing his ingredients. On the other hand Depp just didn't like kids and really expressed that with Mike TV when he kept pretending that he didn't even hear him.

Other than Mike bringing his wimpy dad and Violet bringing her baton twirling mom, the others brought the same gender of parent as the original. The differences were in acting abilities. Other than Mike TV and Charlie, the kids did not act with as much intensity as the original and the parents did not show a great sense of loss or love as their children were stretched or juiced. It seemed as if they went along with Wonka and knew their kids were rotten. For example, Augustus's mom didn't scream out like she did in the first one as he is being sucked up through a pipe. Veruca's father had to be pushed into the ""bad nut"" shoot by a squirrel. Yes I said squirrel. They changed the 'golden egg' to nuts and a bunch of nut crackers - squirrels. The motif of insanity is played on in that scene. Mike TV did not say anything once he was removed from the TV by his father as a little person. His father didn't reflect much facial emotion when they announced he would need to go through the taffy puller machine. The Granpa was OK, but not as 'into' it as the first one. Veruca didn't put her whole heart into being the spoiled brat, she was a little better when she was trying to get a squirrel, but once they carried her to the shoot, her acting abilities were lessened.

The Oompa Loompas were all the same guy - just duplicated and were not midgets, but little men. Their music was different and included many wardrobe changes and even swimming formation acts. They sang after each child disobeyed and made up a song including their name. They left out the Oompa Loompa song - one of my favorites. The oompa loompa also posed as Wonka's psychologist, another indication that Wonka was a little off.

The improvements were the special effects of the elevator and utilizing it during several scenes instead of just the last one. Also, showing the characters leave the factory at the end, was an added plus.

The bubble scene where Charlie and Grandpa fly up was not on this film, and most likely because that was a character building part of the original, where Charlie learned from his mistake and did the good deed giving back the gobstopper. He showed honesty, bravery, and selflessness Burton's film did not show that heart, softer side. It was all about colors.

The added storyline was the relationship between Wonka and his father, which was less than entertaining. Every time there was a flashback, Wonka would black out, thus indicating his further entrapment to insanity. He was reunited with his father at the end of the movie and found enough forgiveness to accept Charlie's family into his factory, but they still kept their little crooked house and moved it into the factory. That was strange - you would think they would have given that up! The other added story was how Wonka found the Oompa Loompas and saved them, yet made them his slaves for chocolate.

Overall I did not see a real moral strength to this film, but merely colors, lights, and sounds... but even the sounds weren't as good as the classic music featured in the original. The children were made out to be brats, with Charlie being the ""less rotten"" of the bunch thus winning the prize. So it would seem it is a typical Hollywood film reflecting what our society, or is it a reflection of what our future holds... uncaring parents, rotten children, and no emphasis on morals."
2,"To be honest I was rather sceptical of the decision to remake such a classic film that has influenced the lives of so many. No-one could ever replace Gene Wilder's embodiment of Willy Wonka and sadly I feel that Johnny Depp failed to.

Depp's characterisation of Wonka seems to be a blend of a Jim Carrey style slapstick caricature mixed with Michael Jackson's 'the child that never grew up' sad underlying personality defects. If this was what the Director was aiming for, Carey would have been far better suited to the role.

The Oompa Loompa tunes and lyrics are an integral part of our culture   how dare they be tampered with! Frankly I think that, other than the technological improvements in terms of production, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory adds nothing the films legacy. An entire generation of youngsters will grow up without ""living in happiness too, like the oompa loompa doopady doo."" It is worth seeing simply to appreciate the fine work achieved in the original. If it ain't broke   don't fix it."
2,i knew this film was gonna be crap before i saw it but i was talked into it and sure enough..it was crap!!! very boring and poorly directed! i can't believe any1 actually enjoyed it!! well maybe kids will like it!! charlie and his family speak with a British accent yet they always use American terms such as 'candy bar' and 'yippee' etc..gets very annoying!! and the oompa loompas? or shud i say..oompa loompa..it is the same character for each one..gets very annoying!!! all in all poor film...one thing that makes it a bit bearable is johnny depp is quite funny sometimes as willy wonka!!! i think kids will like it though!!
2,"I am a huge fan of the original Willy Wonka, and Gene Wilder was a genius in it. He gave the film a beautiful, heartwarming glimpse into the heart of an adult/child. Johnny Depp was absolutely horrible. It was an over dramatized version of play acting. I kept looking at my watch to see when this torture would end. If I hadn't been there with my 9 year old daughter, I would have left after the first hour. If you haven't seen the original, run out and watch it first. The oompah loompah's were so much better and all unique. The kids were better, etc... And, the grandparent's in this new version....jumping out of bed and doing a jig was really over the top. Give me a big break here. Save your $$$ on this one, really."
2,"Perhaps die-hard Burton and Depp fans will find this remake worth watching. I expected a family film, and found a dark interpretation of the Dahl children's book. Depp seems to have found his inspiration for Wonka in Michael Jackson and imitates him almost perfectly - down to the falsetto voice, glasses, and gloves. This Wonka does not like children or their parents and has bizarre flashbacks to his own unhappy childhood (not in the book). Some of the special effects are noteworthy but overall, this is not a happy film. The boy who plays Charlie is a bright spot in this dark film. If you are into goth, Burton, and maybe - art films? you may be satisfied. For me the spirit of the novel was violated and a lot of money was wasted on another remake."
2,"Horrible. I saw this movie last night and I really hated it. I wasn't hoping for an exact remake of the great original, and, with Burton directing, I wasn't disappointed in that regard.

I suppose, for me, it was just a bad marriage of director and movie. It could have been good in another directors hands. But Burton makes ...his own style, I guess you could say. He's made some movies I have really liked: Edward Scissorhands, for example. This, his latest effort, just falls flat for me.

Depp is creepy as Willy Wonka, and that's not really what I wanted. I could never get into the character at all.

If this version of Willy Wonka had been the original, trust me it would not have became a beloved classic.

There is simply no way that this movie will be remembered thirty plus years from now as the original one is today."
2,"I saw this movie when it came out and I was disgusted. I usually like to watch a movie a second and third time to get a better perspective and I usually end up with better outlook that second or third time. Not this movie, every time I watched it I felt more offended and disgusted than the last. This takes all the magic and the charm out of Willy Wonka that you almost feel like puking. How could they have gone from the original to this, ooh wait, I forgot its easy. The rap/hip hop was the first mistake. Why take the great songs and turn them into the lowest form of ""music"" there is in the world. It would have sounded better if a bunch of cats were dying to the beat of the music. Secondly, the actors, besides Johnny Depp, were all flat. They were 2-dimensional and boring. Nothing shone from anyone besides Depp, who wasn't too great either if I may add. Yet it wasn't Depp's fault and I know this, the rest of the cast made him look like a mediocre actor, which he is definitely not. This movie would have done much better if it was cast into a fire before release, that way nobody who saw the original would have to suffer through this pile of feces. Final summary- This movie only appeals to small children and ignorant people who have not seen the original."
2,"I was really excited about this movie considering that I grew up with the original and thought it was great, plus it had Johnny Depp in it (despite the fact that Tim Burton directed it and music was by Danny Elfman). However, from the opening scene where you see the chocolate being poured into molds and hear the creepy music (which doesn't fit the scene AT ALL), I knew it was going to be bad.

The character of Willy Wonka was pathetic. His character was so weak that it was ridiculous to watch. At least in the original, Gene Wilder's character was written to command the attention and seem strange-but-not-someone-to-mess-with. In the new one, Willy Wonka is an absent minded child with no presence (and what's with the make-up?!). This version of Charlie and The Chocolate Factory also revealed too much about Willy Wonka's past, making him a pathetic man, rather than a mysterious candy maker.

Further, all of the Oompa-loompa's being played by Deep Roy was disappointing and frankly, didn't make sense. The flashback scene to discovering the Oompa-loompas was completely unnecessary and added to the ridiculousness of the movie.

I thought that the characters of the 5 children were also poor. Their characters were more like caricatures and the dialogue so contrived that it made me sick.

I would still recommend watching this film if only to better appreciate the original."
2,"While the story line in this version follows Dahl's story closer than the Willy Wonka movie, but it lacks the energy and characterization of the original film. Tim Burton's Wonka is a neurotic runaway child, not the creative and eccentric Wonka in Dahl's story. Burton apparently got wrapped up in the Wonka character, because no one else in this film has any life. The children are cardboard cutouts who either have no real energy or overact when they are not being wooden. Grandpa Joe's character suffers the same fate & Charlie's parents might as well not be in the film at all. Burton tried to make up for this with elaborate sets & all kinds of gadgets & special effects, but those cannot overcome wooden performances and lack of direction.

I said this version followed the original story more closely than the original. However the addition of the byplay being young Willy and his father (who is not in the book) is merely distracting and does not help the story at all.

I am sure Burton felt the rock 'n' roll Oompa Loompa's would be a hit, and I assume the lyrics they sing were in Dah;'s original sorry (I could not understand the lyrics since the music was so loud). But the pithy ditties created by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse in the original were much better and added much more to the story.

Bottom line: a flashy remake which does no justice to the original."
2,"When a movie is based on a novel, it should be able to depict an unexpected visualization of the novel in order to be fresh to the audience. This movie FAILS to do so.

Everything in the movie was so obvious and unoriginal. There could be so much more fascinating things and events that they could have created inside the factory, but they didn't. Everything looked just like how they were described in the book, which really bored me to death throughout the movie.

The actors in this movie were quite pathetic. Johnny Depp was the only one that HAD a personality. The rest of the characters were just there, and each of them showed one emotion throughout the whole movie. (I'd like to give some examples but I don't wanna give away ) OK, it maybe interesting at the beginning, but after 2 hrs of the movie, you get very tired of their monotonic acting.

I simply do not see what is the real goal or mood of this movie. I don't know if its supposed to be funny or meaningful. It tries to connect with a particular theme, but the movie fails to draw the audience well enough for them to actually connect with it. It also tries to somehow be funny here and there by Johnny Depp's ""unique"" facial expression, but there was not one time during the movie that I laughed. The ""jokes"" just seemed forced and were really not funny at all.

So my suggestion is ""Don't watch this movie, especially if you have read the book."" There really is no point in it. The movie is so predictable that before you even watch the movie, you probably know everything about how the movie will proceed.

*** If you HAVE TO go to the movie theater to watch something though, watch ""Wedding Crashers"" instead. It is a lot funnier and fresher. =)"
2,"This movie is a massacre of the legacy of the original. It's dark, with no hope. It's horrendous. The only beauty is the new Wonka movie is magic. Enjoy it. Enjoy it knowing Tim Burton didn't make it!

The Burton movie was dark and more in the style of Edward Scissorhands than the Gene Wilder version.

It's morbid and Depp is almost freakiest as Wonka instead of having a childish charm.

I'm apathetic to the book as it's from the 1960s and we've all grown up a bit since then so any movie doesn't have to be perfect. But this one misses the mark.

I am a massive Wonka fan. I love the Wilder adaptation. He brings character and empathy, something Depp lacks in this monstrosity."
2,"How much have the studios paid for this film to receive uniformly good reviews? Despite looking forward to going (being a fan of both Burton and Deppe) this really is turgid fare. Do yourself a favour and buy the DVD of the original!

1. no moral basis for the film: Where the original had something to say to children and parents alike about how to treat each other Burton's version had nothing but glossy visuals. Charlie has to pass a test in the original that is only resolved at the end. No such test in Burton's - he just wins with some half hearted loose instruction tacked on the end about family being important...

2. dramatic urgency where the original conveyed the whole world's excitement over the race to find the 5 Golden Tickets with wit and immediacy Burton's version was flat and soulless

3. Charlie and his family the original family were intimate and humorous. In it's determination to avoid treading the same ground we lost the closeness between Charlie and his grandfather and the emotional momentum that made us care for Charlie and root for him.

4. Lady Luck Not only did the original have suspense, but it made us think about the nature of luck. It ensured that not only was Charlie's good fortune believable but that his eventual triumph was not about luck at all but about Charlie demonstrating that respect for others and goodness of heart is what leads to happiness and success. No such lessons in Burton's version!

5. Performances The performances in the original were uniformly excellent. In Burton's they were just uniform. As excellent actors as Freddie (2005 Charlie) and Deppe are they, alongside the other actors, were as one dimensional as Burton's duplicated Oompah Loompah's. Anticipating every flagged dramatic turn they sucked the lifeblood out of the film. Nothing was surprising in Burton's version - no matter how many times they did whizzy things with glass elevators. Deppe's Wonka, as bold as it was, was funny for 5 minutes. Once we got it there was no room for the character to develop so it died a death thereafter.

6. Music The original score and lyrics were clear, catchy and contributed to the story. Burton didn't give a fig for Dahl's desire to impart wisdom - instead he tried to ingratiate himself with the adult viewers by giving us pop references in his Oompah Lumpah numbers which did nothing for the story and only put us on some unnecessary tangent.

7. Structure The original was linear, clear and concentrated on developing character and story in tandem. Burton's version tried flashbacks, moral justification/explanations for Wonka's sweet obsession. Not necessary. Wonka isn't Batman. Burton should have learnt from the sweetshop owner in the original. When asked why does Wonka do it he simply replies: Do you ask a bird why it flies? It does what it was born to do. No further exposition required.

8. Script One of the first lessons in scriptwriting is that action is always more interesting than reported action. Don't tell us something, show us! The first ten minutes of Burton's film relies on exposition. Lazy scriptwriting. The original covers the same ground in half the time by showing, not telling.

9. Timing This film was ripe for a remake. The visuals of the title sequence left me ready to love the film. Unfortunately it nosedived into an irretrievable tailspin - Burton missed a fantastic opportunity to put his name right up there with the greats. He remains a brilliant but flawed director. A tragedy for Deppe who rarely misses but who cannot perform without some sort of direction.

10. Art direction does not a film make Where was the wit, humanity, soul? Come on you corporate studios - if you're going to take an all time classic book as your inspiration you have no excuse. Fancy visuals are alright for the Fantastic Four but what we want is to laugh and cry. If you're going to make a killing at the box office the least you can do is make us feel something."
2,"When the new ""Willy Wonka"" movie was over in the theater I felt like screaming. If you are a big fan of the original movie, I suggest you do not go see this travesty of a movie. The children were horribly cast (and all brats - Veruca was tame in comparison), the story's horrible addition of Wonka's father and the overall lack of wit made me want to vomit.

The only saving grace and why I rated this a 2 instead of a 1,was Johnny Depp's performance. He was excellent and a little scary. The oompa loompa was interesting too - he was also worth seeing. If you are going to endure the torture, rent do not pay full price!"
2,"I haven't watched the original film in quite some time, so I don't really know how this one stacks up against it. However, I can say that I did not really enjoy this one, and I thought that I had never seen it before, but I realized in the middle of watching it that yes indeed I have seen it before. Johnny Depp gives his best in personation of Michael Jackson in the height of his wacko Jacko era, and while this does provide a few Chuckles, it just makes the movie weird and not in a fun way. He's not the biggest problem with the movie though, as the biggest problem is Tim Burton's brand of weirdness. I like Tim Burton when the weirdness comes naturally and not when they have hired Tim Burton to be weird. It's kind of like the difference between Edward Scissorhands and that horrible Alice in Wonderland movie. So there's a few good lines in this movie, but I have heard that the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory movie is much better, so either watch the original or that one."
2,"It's not good.

I've seen most of Tim Burton's movies and I think I'm up at 22 of Johnny Depp's. But I don't think I've ever been so disappointed in a movie before. The book (and the sequel, for that matter) are among some of my favorite children's books, and I couldn't wait to see the film adaptation, which I then, afterward, wished I hadn't.

It seems like a poor excuse on Burton's behalf to make yet another Depp movie where he plays a freak, to be frank. Johnny Depp's Wonka was everything Dahl's Wonka *wasn't*, and the movie focuses more on this character than the Buckets. Wonka was initially just a supporting character, in my opinion.

But it drags itself up to two stars for the cinematography or art direction or whatever made the movie beautiful to look at. But muting it while watching wouldn't hurt, it might even save you for the ruining of an old classic."
2,"Skip this horrific remake and rent the original. It had far more class, charm, better performances, and vibrant energy from its cast with rousing, memorable songs. You see, that's what happens when you rely on ACTING and DIRECTING and CREATIVITY instead of special effects. This new one belongs in the garbage heap with the rest of the recent CGI-animated pop-culture trash.

In this new film, Tim Burton has sucked the life out of the chocolate factory, and put it all into computer graphics. That said, Christopher Lee and Deep Roy are decent, and Johnny Depp tries his best to breathe some life into into his character (which is quirky and at times funny), but this dull, thudding remake of the original is so full of sneering, boring, sullen, plodding, snotty performances from the dregs of a supporting cast...it sucks! Each snotty spoiled brat is dutifully trotted out to screw up in Willy's factory and meet some horrible fate...and then the hundreds of clones of actor Deep Roy's Oompa Loompas come out and sing totally unintelligible songs. Willy Wonka keeps yelling at the ""TV kid"" to ""Stop mumbling"" ...and yet every song the Oompa Loompas sing is garbled gobbledegook. I felt embarrassed for Christopher Lee, Johnny Depp and Deep Roy. You don't give one rat's butt about the rest of the cast. I haven't seen a worse group of actors in a long, long time. Perhaps Burton was hoping the CGI would save them? Each scene is delivered with such a lack of enthusiasm and energy, I almost couldn't believe it.

Skip this shlock, and go rent the wonderful original with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka."
2,"What can I say about how incredibly bad this movie was?? Everything about it was just wrong and even mildly offensive...the ugly oompa loompa (as people have mentioned, one ugly little man computer generated into many), Johnny Depp's creepy and weird interpretation of Willy Wonka (I'm not obsessed with Michael Jackson but you can't deny that there are serious similarities including that femininely creepy giggle of his), Danny Elfman's really bad songs (which is weird because I normally love his composing), and the whole back story to Wonka's childhood--completely unnecessary; more character development for the kids could have been used in that time. But that's no surprise given the fact that the plot in general was all over the place and almost sloppy. To top it all off, the pace of this movie is slow, which is odd for a story that has so much going on.

Basically, the whole movie just rubbed me the wrong way and by the time the credits rolled I was certain that I hated it.

I have liked some of Tim Burton's previous work (as well as Johnny Depp's) and though I pretty much knew it wasn't going to live up to the original (and realized it would definitely be darker with Burton at the helm), I never imagined it would be this bad. It's dark and twisted (not in a good way) and just plain creepy with no real heart and charm. When people start making jokes about cannibalism in a ""kids movie"", I think it's pretty safe to say you should head for the exit.

That being said, there were two good things about this movie...one was the boy who played Charlie...probably one of the few actors here that had any genuineness and charm at all....and the sets and special effects. Visually this movie is stunning in parts, but that certainly doesn't save it. Not by a long shot. It is the reason I give it a 2 instead of a 1 however.

If you love the original film like me, save yourself and DO NOT WATCH THIS VERSION. You'll be kicking yourself in the end...I am."
2,"Now here's an example of how NOT to do a remake.

Virtually everything that made the book and 1971 film great, is absent here. There's no Candy Man song, the Oompa Loompas have been dumbed down to 2000's era pop singers, Willy Wonka has been body-snatched, and a very flat performance from the cast.

I felt a small part of me die inside when one of the kids said ""retard"" while playing a Call of Duty-esque game.

Simply one of the worst, most unfaithful, disposable and unnecessary remakes of all time.

The book and original movie will always be classic. But this just took a huge dump all over that."
2,"I remember being a fan of the original movie. Granted I was about five when I saw it, but it seemed to be a fond memory. I wish I could have left it as that. All I wanted to see was painted dwarfs singing the Oompa Loompa song, but instead we get a cloned midget Mexican doing theater.

As a homage to the original:

Oompa Loompa Doopeety Doo, This movie was worse then sitting in poo, Oompa Loompa Doopeety Dee, Rather than seeing this again I would drink my own pee.

My friend got me free passes to this movie, and I still felt compelled to ask for a refund. Complete and utterly boring. No redeeming value what so ever."
2,"I'm already not a big fan of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory franchise, but this movie was the cherry on top of my hatred. The kid actors are fine, pretty impressive work, Johnny Depp was also pretty good but oh my god. Willy Wonka, his character makes me furious. Mainly the very end and his relationship with his father is so boring and it makes no sense. I noticed this pattern in media where in sequels/reboots villains/antagonists get a sad backstory so you feel bad for them (ex: The onceler from the Lorax) but I can't feel bad for a man who I already saw being jolly about killing kids before. Bad movie, Tim Burton disappointed me with this one."
2,"My title pretty much sums it all up really! This film is cold, it's dark and it's depressing! The only thing going for it is that the story is closer to the book! Other than that it offers nothing!

The characters are equally depressing! The kids and the parents just seem miserable! You'd think they'd been dragged kicking and screaming to the factory against their will, and where was Charlie. I thought he was one of the main characters yet as soon as they were in the factory, he was like a side character! Then there is Willy Wonka himself! I don't even know what to say about him! It was just awful! Creepy and Unlikable, and what the hell was his backstory all about?

Nope, when I think of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I think fun, charming, happy. All the things a Tim Burton film ain't!

Big fat stinker!!!"
2,"First of all, let me just say that I am a fan of Tim Burton's films. I love the dark Gothic themes he usually sets his films. But his version of the classic Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory completely ruined it for me.

Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of the worst remakes I have seen. Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is just terrible! And the Oompa Loompa musical numbers are horrible! Also there is no need to add the Willa Wonka back-story into the movie. I did enjoy Freddie Highmore's performance as Charlie and the other children were also good. The set design is great, the only thing Burton did get right.

Overall, this is the worse of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, both of whose work I normally enjoy. This film is a major disappointment."
2,"this is a remake, which is based on a child's novel. I've tried to give this movie higher rating, but it's impossible. Lets get this over quick, unlike this revamp of a classic ""no need to update"" film, which drags on and on and on. First, Johnnie Depp drops the ball for possibly his first time. He comes off scary or creepy, How many people hint to Micheal Jacksonian? pale white, creepy demeanor and aimless babblings? This Wonka is ""to"" alienated and removed from reality, unlike the very wise, eccentric, sarcastic and yet confidently and upbeat as well as resilient Mr. Wonka in the book and 1974 classic film, this Wonka is one slip away from suicide watch or a protection order to stay 1,000 feet away! that right there ruins the entire premise. No matter how many cynical teens or adults (few parents over 30) like this, it was made to be a children's film. an eccentric and wry confectionery King, who loves sweets should never be played so near scary and creepy and weird. eccentric and weirdo are not the same. Also all the kids and parents chosen are bland, forced and uninteresting in there characterizations. The songs are not hum-able, does anyone even mumble to themselves any of the songs throughout this lame flash and shock film? notice how it's rating keep slipping over the 7 years? great film maintain and increase. soon my 2 will be the average,..watch the original, don't waste you time on this big money and hype offering."
2,"I share Gene Wilder's sentiment on this one. ""Hey, let's see if we can make more money off of Willy Wonka"" I hate to cut down a movie like this but it's in my all time top 5 bad ones.

Why? Bad, Bad Bad! I Don't know where to start, they really flushed this one down the toilet. I like Tim Burton, I like Johnny Depp, I've liked everything I've seen Christopher Lee in also but this, eeek! First of all what is with the face make-up? This is Willy Wonka Folks, Not Michael Jackson.

He just wasn't likable either! The character development on him didn't work, it was several minutes of un-needed film. It didn't help the movie.

His bit about cannibalism: Not Funny His bit about his old factory employees: Not Funny I may as well prepare myself for this one because I know that someone out there is reading this comment and thinking ""But, they tried to follow the book with this one"".

Okay, they did the chocolate palace and the squirrel bit and therefore they get credit for ""following the book"". The movie still sucks! They took a classic, a family-oriented masterpiece and royally messed it up. I don't care what they ""followed"" it just wasn't good this time around.

Johnny Depp should have quit after reading the script to this, I've seen him do so much better before.

While we're at it why don't we re-do the Sound of Music with Brittney Spears as Maria von Trapp. Wait, never mind, forget I mentioned that. Just my luck, someone will probably do that.

Gotta give this one a 2 0ut of 10 just for casting, the kids good performance and for a few funny bits. The rest of it is really painful to watch."
2,"Call me a grinch but I found this movie pretty heavy-handed & mean-spirited. I've liked Depp in other things, but his Willy Wonka seems like a called-in performance, on the order of a high-school play where the boys play the girls.

There's a lot of malevolence that seeps through, too, which although pretty common in Tim Burton movies, is really quite pronounced in this one.

The golden-ticket winners are all pretty much set-up as the more reprehensible representatives of a self-involved & greedy society but even so their rather gross methods of dispatch & WW's glee comes off as pretty creepy for family fare. Everything that works in his film is an obvious tribute/homage/borrowing from earlier (& better IMO) films, especially ""The 5000 Fingers of Dr. T"" & the final scene in ""Kid Millions"".

It's not that I would worry about the mental health of my kids seeing this, it's that their health is good enough that I know they would find it seriously wanting."
2,"This is the worst remake I've ever seen. I love the 1971 version and I love Johnny Depp so maybe I was expecting way too much. The special effects were even better in 1971. Depp's interpretation of Willie Wonka reminded me of Edward Scissorhands without the scissors. The boy who played Charlie was very sweet though. To be honest, I've never read the book, so I don't know which version is more true to the Dahl book. However, the 2005 version doesn't even seem to have an anti-climatic ending I missed the bubble scene with Charlie and Grandpa Joe. Why were the oompa loompas all clones of the same guy? Also, it was never clear what they were singing about the children as they were eliminated. When I saw it today, there were only about 20 people in the theater. It seemed like they couldn't get out of there fast enough when the movie ended. I usually like to read all of the credits before I leave, but I suddenly realized I was all alone."
2,"I was deceived by the fairlytale like atmosphere. Starting from burning down the dolls, Crazy Wonka continuously abuses the children. So disgusting."
2,"It's bad in general. Poorly directed, terrible music soundtrack and Johnny Depp is generally creepy as Willie Wonka. I think Tim Burton tried too hard to make it entertaining."
2,"This film tells the story of Charlie Bucket, a child of modest origins who wins, thanks to a golden ticket, the possibility to visit the wonderful chocolate factory of the eccentric industrialist Willie Wonka, whose story is also told through the film, which focuses action in Charlie's journey inside the factory, along with five other children and their parents. The child who reaches the end of the visit can get a prize, but each one has a weakness that will be tested in each room. The result is a series of accidents involving children, who yield to their weaknesses and vices, being readily assisted by their parents and workers of the factory, the Oompa Loopas.

This film was based on the children's novel by Roald Dahl, which already has an adaptation to the cinema dating from 1971. Anyone who has read the book or watch this movie with attention quickly notice that there is a didactic purpose behind the story. All children except Charlie, showed a character flaw, a vice or wrong behavior, and the ""fate"" of them is just the result of failing to resist it (two had addictions - television and chewing gum - one was greedy and another was so spoiled that no one could contradict it). Most children's stories have moral grounds and lessons to be learned, it isn't new and proves its character as a children's tale.

I think Tim Burton, director of this film, conceived it in a mistaken way. This movie seems too adult for a children's story and, at the same time, it seems too childish for a teen audience. So it ends up in a ""middle ground"" between them, a fact that wasn't positive. No one questions the qualities of Tim Burton, who has accustomed the public to great but eccentric films. However, his vocation isn't the children's audience. He has made animated films (""Corpse Bride"" is the most notable example) but they were all directed for adults or adolescents. And this is a children's story, that would have been better in a children's movie. Maybe someone at Disney Pixar can make a good adaptation of this tale."
2,"When I heard a remake was being done of this movie and that Depp was going to star in it I was optimistic. The book was good and the original movie was entertaining as a child, though incredibly dated visually. When I saw the first preview that optimism vanished and I was very disappointed by what I saw. That was reinforced by both the critics' reviews as well as the public reviews after the movie was released.

I opted to wait for it to arrive on DVD, and then only watched it when a friend loaned it to me, and I'm very happy that I didn't spend a penny on this. The movie was absolutely atrocious, and I can't for the life of me figure out how it has an average rating of 7.5 on IMDb. Every person I've ever talked to that has seen this movie did not like it. The movie is so bad that I really don't even know where to begin with a review! Suffice to say that I didn't even stick around to watch the ending, I called it quits about 3/4 of the way through the movie and I very rarely do that, especially if I'm watching a DVD.

The movie, at least what I saw of it, was pretty much word for word and scene for scene, identical to the original. The cast of characters was also the same. The Oompa Loompas looked to me to be digital copies of a single Oompa Loompa, but I'm not positive.

The biggest disappointment to me was Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka. I really like him as an actor, and there are few movies he's put out that I haven't enjoyed, but I couldn't stand him in this movie. This is unfortunate because Willy Wonka is an interesting character that has a lot of potential for a good actor. I don't know how the character was written but Depp played it very effeminately, which seemed to me to just be weird, and not in a good way.

I could go on and on about all the disappointments of this movie, but it really just seems like a waste of time. Whatever you do, no matter how much you liked the book, the original movie, or Jonny Depp, don't pay a cent to see this. If you must see it, wait until it comes out on cable or eventually network television."
2,"I don't understand it, why do people like Tim Burton? I mean, tell me a great film he did? He has done many good films including Edward Siccorhands and Big Fish. I guess people mistake his amazing artistic style with good directing, it is not. He has no sense of emotion in his films, no sense of pace, and no sense of musical style. Charlie and the chocolate factory had a brilliant artistic style except for his art direction in terms of the ""oompa-lumpas,"" which were pitiful compared to the originals. The most glaring fault of the film and what ruined it for me were the horrendous songs, while the original had many tunes which have lived through the ages, this version tried to ""modernize"" these tunes with terrible results. Since this is the heart of the film it utterly ruins the entire experience. The only saving grace of this film is johnny Depp's performance, which manages to make laughs from terrible dialogue and keeps you interested through its sheer spontaneity. In short, an awful film with another showpiece performance by Johnny Depp."
2,"Stupid and primitive movie imposing wrong and corruptive ideas (like communistic) that all poor are good people and the riches are all spoiled, corrupted, bad, etc., who don't deserve all that richness and success they have, that all that is needed to be done is to give to a poor kind man a big successful enterprise and this would be a way to make the world better. How that looser Mr. Bucket (he is exactly like his father and Charlie's definitely gonna be the same)could run the factory if he was incapable to support his own family properly? How these poor kind people could make the world better if they are unable to make their own lives better?

And this is unbelievable that a twelve-year boy is happy with his family though they could not give him anything but a spoiled cap from toothpaste tube and a bar of chocolate once a year. He would be, if he didn't know that other children have normal dwelling, food, toys etc. Family love and support are VERY important, but they are just unable to compensate essentials and all other natural human (and children's) wants. Extremities shown in the movie are not convincing.

Johnny Depp is amusing, as usual. His acting (or rather making grimaces) is the only thing worth seeing in this movie."
2,"I can hardly believe how many positive reviews this movie has received. I have not been this disappointed in a movie since the Blair Witch Project fiasco. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was a painful movie to watch. There were people actually asleep in the theater.

Charlie, played by Freddie Highmore was adorable. Depp was funny in an OCD way, but not enough to carry this joke of a reproduction. The songs were terribly lame. They had ONE Oompa Loompa, played by Deep Roy, and he was digitally reproduced a couple hundred times to make the entire population of Oompa Loompa's in the factory. I almost walked out when I saw that. How can you have ONE Oompa Loompa? I know we have come a long way in digital enhancements but this was just sad and cheap. Someone in Loompaland is rolling over in their grave.

If you love the first one like I did, don't bother spending 9 bucks to see this in the theater. In fact, don't bother spending anything on this...rent or buy the original and pretend this never came out."
2,Creepy and strange just like all the previous Burton films. It also stars most of the actors seen in his previous films. I'm sure it's adored by the non-conformist types because it's different... And I don't mean 'good' different. Just rewatch the version from 71 and watch Gene Wielder put Depp to shame.
2,"It's taken me 13 years to properly sit down & watch this remake. Having not really been a fan of Johnny Depp over the years, I have to say that this film really doesn't suit him. I don't think he was right for the role at all. But then again, who else would be perfect other than the original Gene Wilder.

I've given this one a chance now & finally watched it (right now in 2018) & I just can't get over how bizarre Depp plays the role: creepy, wooden, sarcastically annoying to the children in the film. His laugh is horrendous & his head-bopping to the Oompa Loompas songs & dances. It's like he's at a concert & he's enjoying it more than the children.

The child actors - I don't recognise one single one & can't say I've seen any of them in anything else. Since this movie was made in 2005 I don't think this film has given them any recognition since we're now in 2018 & you never see or hear of any of them. Whereas the 1971 classic is still there in people's hearts (including mine). The original movie with Gene Wilder still holds conventions around the world where the original actors (Peter Ostrum, Julie Dawn Cole) attend for photo signings but I have to say; just what recognition can one give this 2005 remake. The children in this film also show no excitement - no emotion - no laughs or thrills considering they're in a chocolate factory. There's just no engagement & I have to agree with one of the other reviewers on here; watch for the scene when they're in the river boat tearing down at fast speed: the children make no noise of excitement, no screams, no joys. Nothing.

I think the most impressive part of the movie is with the squirrels. I'll give this one credit cause it actually quite impressed me the effects of it. & I think it's trying to show you that squirrels can be quite scary (imagine approaching one yourself & it pouncing on you for attack!)

Can't say I think much of the Oompa Loompas. Never really thought much of Deep Roy (who plays the duplicated Oompa Loompas). I met him once at a convention here in the UK & the guy looked miserable as sin, he looked like he didn't want to be there. Most probably because there was nobody at his table wanting an autograph. I tried to say hello but he just barely said one word back.

I'm not gonna say I dislike this movie nor did I enjoy it. I've just got no feeling to want to watch it again. But the original 1971 is always a classic and when it comes to a good egg, I'll be cracking open the dvd to the original anytime!"
2,"Johnny depp's portrayal of willy wonka was like watching Michael Jackson on an unending LSD trip, sporting the voice of a Christian televangelist's wife. He bumbles through the storyline, seemingly clueless and inept and lacking all self-awareness- a tragic child-man who vomits into his own mouth when compelled to use the words ""family"" or ""parents"" - a stark contrast to the sublimely wise and insightful character portrayed by gene wilder, who drew lines from famous works of literature to draw home didactic points to those wise enough to listen. Depp's Wonka is motivated by some dark, nightmarish past, by a father who not only abandoned him for eating candy, but took the entire apartment complex with him. Poor character portrayals, interspersed with songs so blatantly bad one hopes, even as you hear them, that they will be utterly forgettable. The fact that the soundtrack makes the lyrics difficult to discern thankfully helps in that regard.

I liked nightmare before Christmas and believe Tim burton has talent, but watching the repetitious motifs/moods/tones of his movies is like watching George Lucas futilely churn out Star Wars episodes 1 and 2, and wondering how episode 4 ever came from the same formulaic mind.

I sadly wish I had never seen this movie. It's pedophilia undertones and creepy portrayal by Depp have marred the original forever for me."
2,"The most pathetic movie ever, never expected that. The opening was real good but then each passing minute brought it down crashing till there was left nothing but debris in the end. I believe that those extreme efforts which were put in to make this movie thoroughly unpredictable from the very beginning actually spoiled what could have been a brilliant tale. I went watching this movie only because i like Johnny Depp's acting skills a lot but soon i realized that any good movie isn't just made up of highly skilled actors or strong line up of charterers, instead it's an art of story telling that not everyone can master. every exquisite cinema is the eye-craft of an equally brilliant director. This one turned out to be a totally senseless-hopeless cinema for me."
2,"I like the ending, very much indeed! At our local Odeon Cinema we went to see it and, although I though ""oh what a nice ending! You just can't ask for a happier ending!"", in spite of that part, I thought of this film as, if you like, very stale, soggy old sweets (long past its sell-by-date) when compared to the 1971-classic. Now that was a GREAT film and it's just a shame my 7-year-old step-brother (who will be 8 pretty soon) watches it non-stop, all-day, everyday! I'm not stopping him but, you know, it is quite annoying when you see the same film, the same music, the songs, the same actors, the same voices (that get irritating), the same picture, the same narrative, the same settings, the same introduction - OHH! It's VERY annoying but he is only 7 going 8, I suppose so he is still quite young. Perhaps he ain't too keen on the stupidity of this new updated version, either. I wouldn't blame him if he did because this is an hour and fifty minutes of absolutely idiotic dullness. What made Warner Bros. think that them pathetic songs would appeal to anyone, which (more fool them) people did like, especially my sister, Nat. The songs from the original like, ""Pure Imagination"", ""The Candy Man Can"", ""The Oompa Loompa Theme"" and more are classics and the new songs in this 2005-update are simply incompetent in comparison - they're poor, they're rubbish, they're irritating, they're not at all entertaining and worst of all, the acting! OH the acting! I hate it! Johnny Depp looks absolutely ridiculous as Willy Wonka not to mention girlie, he looks like he's a drag queen here and Veruca Salt lacks the attitude of a spoilt, bratty, I-Want-It-Right-Now kind of girl, she seems extremely rational, her voice is very dull, the boat-ride in the factory is totally unexciting, the factory-tour is dull, Grandpa Joe's performance irritates me and if there is any comedy all I can say is that it's unfunny and completely ridiculous. If this is what Roald Dahl would've wanted all this time then for one thing more fool him and for another thing I pity him! What kind of imagination did he have exactly? An unimpressive one by what it sounds! I'm no fan of his published works, to be honest!"
2,"After his ""Planet Of The Apes"" 'reimagining', I didn't think Tim Burton could do any worse. Perhaps he might try to redeem himself by taking on smaller, more personal films like he used to. Or at least if he would again tackle larger films, inject them with the same twisted whimsy that made his early films so memorable. Boy was I wrong. The moment ""Charlie And The Chocolate Factory"" started I knew I was in for a soulless, uninspired mountain of drivel. From the heavy oompah-pounding and oh-so eerie choir that Danny Elfman has used ad nauseam, to the moderately quirky visuals that Burton seems to be comfortable with (he must have forgotten the wonderful art direction from ""Beetlejuice"" or ""Edward Scissorhands""), to Johnny Depp's mediocre portrayal of Willy Wonka, everything about this shameful mess was wrong. Was Burton trying to stick close to the book while injecting it with small references to the Mel Stuart film? Maybe he was trying to do the opposite, redoing the film while here and there tucking in a nod to the Roald Dahl book. Whatever he was trying, he failed, miserably. There is none of the charm or lightheartedness from the Mel Stuart version, none of the smart, dark sarcasm from the Roald Dahl story. Instead there was just a flat story, flat acting, and a flat musical score. I didn't care about a single character, least of all Charlie. The subplot of Willy Wonka and his father added nothing at all. In fact, it removed all the mystery from the Wonka character, leaving us with an unfulfilled man-child who had to fill the void of a loveless relationship with a love of candy. Is this supposed to be a moral of some sort? If so, then Tim Burton should follow his own lesson: cramming the screen with creepy giggling and screaming visuals does not make for a reimagined piece of genius. It makes for a flavorless gobstopper that is indeed everlasting."
2,"The original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" is one of my all-time favorite movies. I knew there was a very slim possibility that I would like the remake as well or better, but I gave it a chance and watched it with my kids... and I absolutely hated it. I am stunned that people like this movie. In the original, one of the best things is the wonderful music. Who can forget the song Gene Wilder sings in the chocolate room, or the opening song in the candy store, or Grandpa Joe and Charlie singing ""I've Got a Golden Ticket""?... these are only three of the many great songs that enrich the 1970's version. In this new film, however, the only songs are those that are sung by the Oompa-Loompas after each child's demise, and, ohhhh... how incredibly stupid and annoying those songs are. Johnny Depp's performance as Willy Wonka made me want to vomit. And the thing is, I normally love Johnny Depp. I think he is one of the most talented actors out there... but he was awful in this movie. I totally agree with the people who are saying he reminded them of Michael Jackson. Creepy and irritating. The absolute worst was the ditzy valley girl way in which he said, ""Kay?!"" after each command given to an Oompa Loompa. The kid who played Charlie was okay... one reason why I gave this movie a vote of 2 instead of only a 1. But I sure did like the original Charlie better. In the original movie, I cared about Charlie a lot more. I liked the attention that was given to the development of his character, what with the scenes at his school, or when he is peering longingly into the window of the candy shop, or the touching scene at his mom's work. There was none of this depth in the new movie. The hour and a half that I wasted watching this movie is an hour and a half of my life that I can never get back! All I can do is warn other people... if you haven't seen it yet, you aren't missing anything... don't waste your time!"
2,"My main beef right off the bat is this___________ ___________________ You know what that is? That's dead space, dead frickin' air. Fill in the blank. You have producers who pay the director to pay actors to ACT! But never mind the whys of why this film is bad. Lets get into the particulars, as yes you must compare it to the 1971 version. It's the same story, the same characters, some of the same dialogue. The overall feel of this film experience is flat and joyless with a hint of perverse smarm. How many times can you put up a lame piece of dialogue for the very talented and charismatic Johnny Depp to read and you get a Milk Dud back and more actors stare back in hipster amazement? These actors, their talent not withstanding do doubt auditioned hard and spent hours in the makeup chair, only to shine for a very brief moment when they get to express their characters'...motivation (?@) But the focus is all on Depp and oh what a wonderfully lovable weird character he's supposed to be. Well, lovable only in Charlie's eyes. Tim Burton is a pretty weird looking guy himself, does he think it's funny when people stare at hi whenever he says something? What if an AD stared at him like a Klingon when asked to adjust a light or get him coffee? He's be fired! The only reasoning for this logic could be the typical projection that goes on between a director and his favorite actor, who represents an idealized version of the director himself. Maybe it's to poke fun at himself, for directors surely need that. To quote Francis Coppola ""I think the film director is one of the last truly dictatorial positions in society today"". And thus it's those guys who truly have tasted success that go on to make films that are truly out of touch with their audience. Maybe you just want to please the mall audiences that will chew and chuck their popcorn and mimic their annoying mirror images on screen ala Mike Teavee and Violet Beauregarde. But I am a film fan and intellectual who writes long rambling online reviews....someone kill me!......and I've seen the original and it's great and want this movie to be good, or at least worthwhile...watchable...anything....

What a waste of time and resources. for every second of irony-stupefecated silence gawking at WW is time that could have been spent exploring the individual characters. Not that I needed to see more about their lives, but they're on the tour, give em a shot to say something witty, something original for Chrissakes. The whole mumbling bit, repeated by Wonka to Teavee is just hostile. The makeup of Violet B. and her mom is is the only improvement from the original I think. Between her and Teavee you truly get an illustration of what the suburbs produce, hackers and fitness gurus, TV junkies and snipey Caucasians. Veruca Salt this time, is ultimately played with some subtlety, but I preferred the manic unrelenting sledgehammer that was the original girl. A rare role for the great James Fox (see Performance, people!) goes largely wasted, as Mr. Salt, for all secondary roles are relegated to gawking and sighing in resignation. ""Am I the only sane person here?"" he thinks. Augustus Gloop is just a joyless,unfortunate and scary sight. You at least feel good for him in the end as he walks out saying he tastes good. At least he has some self-esteem.

The irony spreads, even to Charlie Bucket's family. Kudos to the set designers for making their abode incredibly crappy, that works. The relatives in bed are given some catch-phrases to work with, but they too are not immune to gawking with impunity as the candy-crazed drama plays out. Charlie's parents are the only ones who have an excuse not to overact, or what passes for emoting here. They simply work hard and are too tired for active parenting. BTW it's a surprise to see Helena Bonham Carter here, due to her propensity for breaking up her directors marriages including Burton and Lisa Marie. Yo...how does that happen? and Yo....where's Charlie's paper route? And yo....who blew the budget so wide open they could only afford one Oompah Loompah and simply CG'd the rest. Again, another example of this version's lack of soul.

Now Johnny Depp. He's a fine actor, he's right for the part, but not everything he's capable of can turn around a bad script and a director in a slump. Oh why do directors give in to ironic staring and DADDY COMPLEXES! Every damn movie I see has the main character fighting through endless melancholy from a bad relationship with their father. Actually this one is well realized, the whole thing with Dad Denist Christopher Lee, always welcome, a Burton stalwart. But to have this infect Willy Wonka, in the current context of Michael Jackson-isms lingering too near the surface and too near the children, it's just too damn creepy to even go there.

All in all with the extra details chucked in, it's all tied together rather quickly at the end. You know the Bucket's integrity will never be questioned so you don't need the Fizzy Lifting Drink episode. So the weird Wonka and the bewildered Bucket are in business together. I give 'em 10 years before Charlie wises up, has Wonka committed to an asylum and sells his stock in the company to Mr. Salt. It's just business."
2,"I have been dreading seeing this movie ever since I heard that it was being remade. I am a huge fan of the Gene Wilder version and still sing along to it when it comes on TV. That will not be happening with this film. There are no catchy tunes in this version, you can't even understand the words never mind want to remember them. I feel sorry for the little children out there who will grow up watching this version and miss out on the cool songs from the original.

I was very distressed by the Oopma Loompas in this film. The sight of Deep Roy replicated thousands of times was not a nice sight. They were not as fun and cute as in the original and as previously mentioned their songs were awful. They ruined the movie for me. Every time they appeared on screen I cringed.

I felt that this version lacked the warmth and humor of the original. Depp's Wonka was cold, childlike and unfriendly. The fact that he refused Charlie's family to live in the factory was bizarre. Nothing like the book or the Wonka character we love. While Depp acted very well I just didn't feel that he was Willy Wonka. I much prefer Wilder's quirky version. You know he has a dark side and is a little insane but you love him, with the Depp version it made you wonder why Willy Wonla would want to open up his factory to children and give it away if he hates everyone so much.

One aspect of the original film that I liked was when we got to see Charlie at school and working on his paper round, you realize that he is a lonely boy with no money and therefore no friends. In the new version, Charlie is never seen anywhere except on one street or in his house, he doesn't talk to anyone except his parents. He doesn't come across as such a sorrowful character as in the original and so you don't really care about him as much.

I will not be watching this again, I will however watch the original thousands of times."
2,How did we as a species collectively move on from this catastrophe? 2005 was meant to be the end. We spit in the face of God with every breath we take
2,Seriously. I love Tim Burton but this movie was not great at all. He did not improve on the classic at all. I think too many changes were made in this updated version. I don't think that the audience need that much detail about the small details. I think that they cut too much out.
2,This movie is total garbage. Seriously lacks the soul that the original has. Of course thats to be expected considering its done by Hollywood's supreme master of over doing it Tim Burton. JUst another addition to a long list of stories this guy has massacred. Johhny Depp is a great actor but his performance in this is terrible. He is very annoying and trying far too hard to seem eccentric. It was very hard to watch for me. Everything about this movie tries far to hard to achieve something it just could not. Using one actor for all the umpa Lumpas was a big mistake also. Freddie Highmore is great but the casting for the rest of the children was awful. I find it pointless that this project was even attempted at all. It is stupid to remake classic movies that are under 40 years old.
2,"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" is a lackluster adaptation that falls flat in several aspects. Here's why:

Flat Execution: The film fails to capture the whimsical magic of Roald Dahl's original story. The vibrant world of Willy Wonka's chocolate factory feels disappointingly two-dimensional.

Posh Charlie: The portrayal of Charlie Bucket, played by Freddie Highmore, lacks the genuine charm and relatability of the character from the book or 70s film. Instead, he comes across as a polished drama school student, missing the heartwarming innocence we expect.

Dull Characters: All the characters, including the eccentric Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp), suffer from a lack of depth. Mediocre acting and poor dialogue also don't help.

Missing Impact: Unlike the 1971 adaptation (""Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory""), this version lacks impact. The emotional moments fall flat, and very little humour.

Warmth Deficit: The film lacks the warmth and genuine connection between characters that made the original so endearing. It's a missed opportunity to evoke the same feelings of wonder and joy.

Forgettable Songs: The film's musical numbers fail to leave a lasting impression. They lack the catchy tunes and memorable lyrics that made the original so delightful.

In summary, ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" pales in comparison to its predecessor. If you're craving nostalgia, stick to the classic. ????"
2,"I love the original. I hate the remake. The remake was stupid. They used the same umpaloopas. They same guy. They did not have different ones. They used, the same one. To much computer crap to it. It was so out there. No one can survive in a little house with wholes everywhere. The original, they had a complete house. They went way to far with the remake, I am shocked that Johnny Depp chose this film. It sucks.... All the characters were annoying. Charlie was a small cocky child. The grandpa is a child predator. They added in so much stuff and they took out so much stuff.

I give it a 2/10. The reason is that I am shocked it made it to theaters. This movie is so over- rated"
2,"Too many add-ons to the Wonka background and distortions of the Wonka character. Yep, the 1971 version of Willy Wonka was the book's Wonka. Just like in the book, nothing was known about the great candy man's background other than his being betrayed by his fellow candy makers and his finding the oompa loompas. Where, why did Burton cook up these pace slowing flashbacks with the warped daddy, drawn out decision making of Charlie and that ludicrous ending?

Why did Burton once again put Depp as the star? Not only I'm getting tired of seeing this happening but there doesn't look like there was any credence to them as professionals for doing so. I can think of at least three other stars who could have made the character come off funny with the lines given--Not Depp it just doesn't work. It's the worse case of miscasting I've seen this year.

As others have said neither does the acting of the parents of these other kids work. There's no hysteria when these bratty children are harmed. The change in what happened to Veruca is not fit for sensitive children and seeing them at the end--well besides the garbage looking fake to me, it didn't appear they had learned from the ordeal. I learned something; not to recommend this claptrap to anyone.

The only reason to see this film is the boy who plays ""way too saintly"" Charlie."
2,"I have no idea what Depp was going for in this movie. I have heard he played Wonka as a stoned George Bush but i don't see it. He plays him like a special needs child. His charachter is just terrible, and I'm a Johnny Depp fan. On the upside, they do make it reminiscent of its roots by using all the vibrant colors."
1,"Tim Burton kept saying he wanted to make a version much more faithful to the source material, which leaves me wondering why he didn't.

There's the awful (and unnecessary, and counterproductive) back story showing Wonka's childhood, which is nothing more than an excuse for Burton to bring in one of his horror movie heroes from childhood (Christopher Lee) while completely killing any sense of mystery Wonka might otherwise possess.

I like Johnny Depp, but his Wonka had zero warmth...and was just plain creepy and random - one minute he's snippy and/or oblivious to the kids, the next he's paternal, offering Charlie some nourishing hot chocolate because he ""looks like he could use it"" (and because it's a line from the book).

Wonka in the book is a spritely little gent...neither Gene Wilder nor Johnny Depp are really much like him (much less so Depp), but Wilder's interpretation always has that twinkle in his eye - you know he's a little eccentric but he's always in control. The kids in this version are all pretty good. But Wonka himself? Yikes. Give me Gene Wilder's version over creepy Johnny Depp's Michael Jackson take any day.

The Oompa-Loompa musical numbers blew. The first one, in the chocolate room, was okay. But overall, I had a hard time understanding most of the lyrics. It was all just raucous noise. Come on, Elfman, you can do better than that.

Wonka telling Charlie he can't bring his family to live with him in the factory was insane. First of all, it makes Wonka look even more like a freaky pedophile; second of all - how on earth is that faithful to the book?!

This is the second time in recent memory I've heard of a producer/director wooing the widow of a beloved children's book author and then she deciding that her dead husband would love this new big-screen version of his source material.

Somewhere, Dr. Seuss is consoling Roald Dahl."
1,"This movie was simply awful. Willy Wonka lacked the warmth, humor and wit that was shown by Gene Wilder in the original. The use of one person as the Oompa loompas comes off as cheap production, whether it was or not. The changes made, even subtle ones such as the order or events between Charlie finding the money and getting the last ticket and the introduction of the elevator just seem off. One of the most memorable moments is left out, which is the fizzy drink that makes Charlie and Uncle Joe float around.

The oompa loompa sequences are horrible, the main characters fail to connect with the viewer as they did in the original.. I could go on and on but will just end by saying....

This movie is proof that new technology, different actors, producers and directors do not always equal a better experience.

Save your time and your money... buy and watch the original. My 5 year only daughter even prefers it over the new."
1,"I honestly cannot see why anybody would like this rubbish over the original. Whereas the 1971 version sparkled with innocence, charm and magic, this monstrosity will leave you feeling violently ill and internally disturbed by the time the closing credits roll.

Let me begin by saying I don't personally enjoy Tim Burton's style, and didn't like the dark influence he brought to this film. Depp's Wonka is perhaps the creepiest character I've ever watched in a movie. Unlike Gene Wilder's eccentric yet loving Wonka, he openly expresses his disgust and hatred towards the children. One need only watch the scene in which a shrunken Mike Teavee is nearly stabbed by a vicious-faced Oompa-Loompa, or the one in which Veruca Salt is dragged screaming into the garbage chute while Wonka pretends he cannot find the right key to let Mr. Salt into save his daughter, to understand Wonka's cruelty. In the original, Wonka seemed merely disappointed and bored during the children's accidents, and he always kept his head; he knew no harm would befall the young troublemakers. Here, we see Wonka laughing, dancing and cheering as the Oompa Loompas sing about children being turned into chocolate and eaten.The scenes of the four naughty children's punishments were incredibly disturbing, and the jokes about cannibalism just made me cringe at the stupidity of it all.

Charlie Bucket, who should have been the main character, was a disappointment. Throughout most of the film he seems rather expressionless and bored, unlike the genuine and honest boy played by Peter Ostrum in the original movie. The 1971 Charlie had a dream; he wanted more than his poverty-stricken life, he strived to help his family out of tight situations, he wasn't perfect, but he was a believable character, and that's what made him so lovable; he was just like us all. This Charlie doesn't seem to care about anything; he seems perfectly happy with his life and hardly seems to care about getting a golden ticket. The other children are equally disappointing; Violet Beauregarde manages to pull off her characters fairly well, but even so she had little to work with.

The songs in the original were hopeful and inspiring, such as the charming 'Candy Man,' and 'I've Got a Golden Ticket,' the heartwarming 'Cheer up Charlie,' and the magnificent 'Pure Imagination.' In this new version,the only songs we get are a cheesy welcome song in which childlike puppets explode and melt into ghoulish wraith like figures, plus the nauseating Oompa-Loompa filth. The emotional 1971 ending with Wonka, Charlie and Grandpa Goe in the elevator has been replaced with Wonka refusing the other Buckets to enter the factory, becoming a hobo, and eventually reuniting with his abusive dentist father (???)

In a short review with a maximum of 1, 000 words I simply can't do justice to the badness of this movie, so I'll leave it at this: the old movie has a positive and uplifting message that will bring tears to even the coldest eye. This one crushes the viewer down into the dust while screaming its message into their face. So, unless you enjoy stupid jokes, children in despair and nauseating songs, don't waste any money on this soulless, emotionally disturbing piece of filth."
1,"First of its important to say that I am a Roald Dahl fan, and indeed a fan of the original 1971 film Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. What that film and the work of Roald Dahl have in common is charm, warmth, eccentricity etc. This Tim Burton film does not share in any of it. Having sat and forced myself to watch the entire film hoping something good would happen I was left feeling nothing but empty. I enjoyed most of Tim Burton's work and was rather excited about this film when it was announced, the trailers never gave away too much and I kept on hoping right up until the credits rolled. So whats so bad about it then? My first massive problem with the film is the reactions from the children through the film. Were they sedated during filming? Watch the scene where they tear down the chocolate river in the boiled sweet boat, does one of them even scream in delight? are they not amazed they are on a boat made from candy on a river of flowing chocolate? Most of the time they stand there looking like they would rather be somewhere else, how are we supposed to believe in the wonder of this amazing factory if the kids there aren't even impressed (too much blue screen work perhaps, means the poor actors had nothing to be amazed at)

my second not quite as massive problem with the film is Burton's muse Johnny Depp. Perhaps their relationship is getting stale but Depp's performance as Willy Wonka was nothing but irritating; less eccentric, more pathetic. The creepy grey skin, luminous teeth, puppy dog eyes and hushed voice all add up to a character that I was bored of in the first 5 minutes after seeing him. The ridiculous back story of his childhood was totally superfluous and added nothing to the film, it's like Burton really wasn't trying 'why does wonka love candy....? hmmmm maybe his father was a wicked dentist who wouldn't let him eat it... I could get christopher lee to play him! get on to casting!' Wonka was supposed to be a man with years and years of experience behind him, a weathered eccentric not an excitable/sedated puppy

point number 3 THE MUSIC, perhaps the worst score to a film I have ever heard, Danny elfman, shame on you. OK so they wanted to bring the songs up to date but jeez the music is just bad, the incidental music is bad also, its all bad.

#4 the Oompa Loompa's. this really made me sad, really sad, so in the revised book they are like miniature cavemen, in the 1971 film they are crazy psychedelic dwarfs, in this film they are... one man, one dwarf, Burton employed him in 'Big Fish' he did OK there but he is so wrong for the part of an oompa loompa and why does he have to play all of them? another gimmick that I suspect Burton really didn't waste any time over coming up with, his expressionless face might have worked as a sad clown but the cheeky Oompa Loompas? I think not there were a few god points, the authenticity (minus the stupid flashbacks) I loved seeing the candy boat in all its glory, the fudge mountain , an actual glass elevator rather than the weird gold thing in the 1971 film but who really cares about all these things when not one person in the film seemed to be impressed by it, did the crew record dry run rehearsals by accident? ( by the way the original elevator of the book didn't have rockets on the side it used sky hooks and was powered by sugar but kids would just laugh at that right?) It was nice to see charlie's dad regardless of the fact he is of no importance to the film. The sets were OK but lacked any real wow factor.

basically if you took burtons script chucked out all the nonsense hired a new director kept the sets and gave them a bit more wow and hired a new sound guy and told everyone to smile and have a laugh it wouldn't be that bad, but that didn't happen, mores the pity. OK so one day, say 30 years from now I will make it again its the only way I can resolve my issues with this disaster.

in short if you are a roald dahl fan and like the 1971 film DO NOT WATCH THIS, honestly I regret ever seeing it"
1,"Absolutely awful. Sorry, it's the truth.

I wanted it to be good too. The original is brilliant, a timeless piece of pop culture. But what Tim Burton did to this film... OK, picture Fred Durst, Avril Lavigne, the Spice Girls, and the New Kids on the Block covering ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Drunk. That is really how bad this film is.

My biggest problem with the film is that they left out Charlie's sin. I mean, no fizzy lifting drinks? C'mon!! One of the things that humanized the original Charlie, the polite and thoughtful one amongst a pastiche of brats, is that Charlie too broke the rules, and reasonably invoked Wonka's wrath. Charlie's innate good nature eventually redeems him, Also, for Darwin's sake, cut out the music. ""PAINFUL"" is the only word I can conjure to describe it.

I will admit that I have not read the Dahl novel, so I do not know if the original included all the drudgerous background on Wonka. However, the constant flow-killing flashbacks slows the pace of the movie to a crawl, and normally Depp's acting can carry any role, but this script and character rendering were just terrible. Perhaps the background information on Wonka should have been one big chunk in the beginning of the movie, because spacing it out has no build-up value at all.

Also, worst voice on a Depp character, well, ever.

There really was nothing to redeem this piece-of-crap moneysucker. I can't believe I actually wasted $12 to see it. Between this, ""The Stepford Wives,"" and ""Godzilla,"" I have lost all faith in the movie industry."
1,"I was actually excited to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything, I was just intrigued to see another Tim Burton film. The pictures in the film and the factory were spectacular and mesmerizing. Without even paying attention to the story line it was clear this was a Tim Burton film, truly fantastic. But Like watching a model trying to ponder physics, the beauty is only skin deep. Where was the heart in this movie? The acting, the dialog, the people all fell short of human behavior.

Small example: A child spoiled all her life only taunts her father with the resounding demand: ""I want it Daddy."" Where's the yelling, the screams, has no one EVER SEEN a tantrum??

Additional Example: The parents seemed hardly upset with their children's misfortune. As a parent would you not run out and help your daughter if she were attacked by ANYTHING much less squirrels?!

The Ompa Loompa problem: I loved them actually. Tiny, creepy, and what a great story on how they were found. They were great until they broke into a bad Britney spears song and dance. What the #*!$*#& was that?!

Flashback problem: I loved johnny's character, quirky and fun. Nevertheless, the flashbacks didn't add much at all to anything. And they were executed in the WORST WAYS i've ever seen. ""sorry I was having a flashback."" They are far better ways to have had those worked honestly.

The T.V. kid: was he really so horrible? I mean yes, he was obnoxious, but it doesn't take t.v. to do that. In fact, didn't t.v. just make him smart? Is it so awful that he figured out how to find the bar with the ticket? T.V. didn't turn his mind to mush, it made him the smartest kid who was just annoying and stubborn.

The ending: Horrible, horrible, horrible. I don't even want to talk about it.I was actually excited to see this movie, I wasn't expecting anything, I was just intrigued to see another Tim Burton film.

1,"This movie was simply awful. I am waiting for someone, anyone, to point out that Johnny Depp was just terrible. The first twenty minutes, in a grandiose fashion, leads us to a giant man named Willy Wonka who can put the world on it's toes by putting gold tickets inside five candy bars. Then when you meet Wonka, he's nothing. Johnny Depp is as pale as a sheet; I'm not referring to his white makeup and fake white teeth, but his acting. He's doing an imitation of Jim Carrey doing an imitation of Michael Jackson. His Wonka not believable at all. The kids are just bad. Rich, and bad. You get the whole Hollywood push of ""rich kids are evil, while poor kids are perfect"", meanwhile, what about the children of Hollywood actors and producers and directors, are they exempt because their parents are artists instead of capitalists? I don't get it. I just don't get it. I really don't get this at all. This movie was so terrible. The songs were horrid. One Oompa Loompa playing them all of them was cheap and lame; and the songs made me hide my head in disgust. And there is a segment where Burton pays ""tribute"" to Stanley Kubrick's ""2001"", and it's all but blasphemous to people like me who literally worship classic films. In the original, Gene Wilder was believable. He really seemed like the character. He was the character. But Depp, as usual, was simply performing. Horrible. Horrible. One of the worst movies I have ever seen. A C.G.I. overkill."
1,"While some may say this terrible film is more like the original book that the 1971 movie, but overall, it really isn't. My kids actually have the book and I read through it right after watching the DVD.

This film may be more true to the book with some of the finer details (the original lyrics to the Oompah Loopah songs, Charlie having a living father who worked at a toothpaste factory), none of these details add anything to the story.

On the other hand, the creepy, gray-skinned, androgynous Wonka is nothing like the original character in the book. He hates children (so why does he want to give the factory to one?). He can't even say the word ""parents."" He even hates old people. There is absolutely nothing funny, amusing, or likable about him (BTW, the dialogue in the movie is purely awful). By the time there's a feeble attempt to redeem Wonka's character at the end, it's too late. And where were the childhood flashbacks of Wonka in the book? So much for ""more true to the book.""

I saw the 1971 movie as a kid, and enjoyed it. But I watched it many years later as an adult, and LOVED it. There's so many great lines in it that I missed as a six-year-old. If you read a little about the history of the making of the movie (look online), you'll find that the script at one point was originally developed more for adults than children. It's no wonder, because much of the humor is more geared for adults.

Wilder plays the role of ""Wonka"" like it was made for him. Also, I believe the 1971 film story additions made for a much better story than the original book, and allowed you to see much further into the characters. Maybe I feel this way because I saw the movie before reading the book, but who can ever forget the scene near the end where Charlie shuns the opportunity for ill-gotten gains, even with his own Grandpa encouraging him to do the opposite. Wow. After seeing that, the book's ending seems kinda dull."
1,"Ahem, where do I start? When seeing this movie the first thing that struck me was the ""exciting"" music at the beginning which reminded me a bit of Harry Potter. The opening scene was absolutely riveting, showing the wrapping of bars of chocolate. I almost fell off my sit because I was so intrigued. The beginning of the film surpassed itself in making us realize by about 2 minutes of it that it was going to be absolutely dreadful. The real fun began when we met Willy Wonka. I won't say who he reminded me of.. anyone who's seen the film would know and I don't want to spoil the pleasant surprise for those of you who haven't yet had the honour. The oompaloompa dances were possibly the worst things I have ever seen. Who choreographed them?! I want to meet this insane idiot! It literally made me want to puke. They had an eerie kind of synchronization which was so unnatural that it was scary. I admit to finding the first dance slightly amusing but by the time I'd got to the 4th I was just staring at the screen in disgust.

Words of warning: Don't go and see this sad excuse for entertainment. See the original!!"
1,"My wife & I went to see this today (3rd August2005); we were really looking forward to it because of all the media hype and the trailer looking great.

To be honest we both love the original move with Gene Wilder (1971), I also read the book many years ago and enjoyed that as well.

This version we felt was such unadulterated rubbish that we walked out after an hour.

We felt that Johnny Depp was useless as the character as he came across way too young - after all it was supposed to be over 20yrs since Grandpa Joe worked there - Willy didn't look a day over 35 which would have meant that he was but a teenager when he opened the factory.

Deep Roy did a good job at acting as the Oompa Loompas although the musical scenes were so crap it begs belief that Tim Burton actually wasted the money doing those scenes.

I think that using a primarily British cast was a new twist! About the only things in our opinion that had improved over the 1971 version was the visual effects - these were excellent; and giving some background to some of the characters was also a good idea.

Overall given that we could only bear to watch the first hour, I would say, don't waste your money - go and rent the 1971 version from the local video store."
1,"I went to see this film as I am a big Johnny Depp fan, but I was completely turned off by the whole thing. The pace was so slow I was almost asleep, and I kept waiting for the magical moments to happen. Alas, they never did. The opening went on for ever and a day - remember the wonderful entrance Gene Wilder makes in the original? Well, Willy Wonka's entrance here, with the stupid ""song"" of the puppets, was just dire. He actually looked embarrassed to be there. The parents of the ""lucky winners"" were one-dimensional to say the least, and although the child actors were OK they were nothing to write home about. My 11 year old son went with me to see this film, and as we came out of the theatre I was wondering what he would have to say about it (and whether I would have to pretend that I had liked it!) but the first thing he said was, ""Well, that's not the best film I've ever see. Bit of a disappointment really."" I just felt that the director had wasted so many opportunities, not to try to emulate the first film, but to bring some fresh magic to the wonderful story. Instead, all we got was long-drawn out scenes, bad dialogue and a faintly embarrassed Johnny Depp."
1,"This is a horrible horrible version of this movie. Where in the hell in the book does Wonka talk to his father. And the part where Wonka denies Charlie the factory because he wants to bring his family, absolutely ridiculous. Wonka is supposed to be an inspiration. Not a jerk who has a magical moment with his father. The characters are just completely screwed up. Why on earth would this remake even be considered good. My next problem Oompa Loompas. Where did this freakin idea come from. This movie may have been considered good only if you have never seen one: the original movie two: you have never read the book and three: you have never seen a johnny depp movie. All around a horrible movie. Never waste you time renting this."
1,"I don't know how in the WORLD this film received 7.5 out of 10! This was such an insult to the original ""Willie Wonka"" that it should make Gene Wilder want to spit! The plot was ridiculous, the songs were lame, the script stunk, I mean I can't figure out what Burton was on when he threw this together. I know it made a lot at the box office because everyone anticipated that it would have been as excellent as the first, but to come to this website and see that it received this many votes, who in the world are you people? It was the worst 40 minutes of my life! 40 MINUTES BECAUSE I SPENT THE REST OF THE TIME FAST FORWARDING THROUGH THE THING! I am just truly embarrassed at how sad this film was and how very boring! When I think back to the 1970's version I remember being filled with happiness and contentment, what a beautiful tale, and how very entertaining! I mean everything about it! My cousin and I can still quote the entire film and still find it HILARIOUS! Then we have this present day flop where they duplicated the ugliest midget they could find OVER 1,000 times! Talk about saving money! I realize Johnny Depp has only been in about 3 good movies in his whole career, I should have remembered that before I rented this film! Do yourself a favor and see the ORIGINAL! Never mess with excellence!"
1,"I'm not much of an avid reader so I never read the original book but I watched the original movie. I loved the original movie and this one seems like a sick, demented, Tim Burton twist on the beloved original. I will never let my kids watch this. I don't see how anyone can say that this is a family movie. To make things worse the oompa lumpas were played by one ugly person. This has to be one of the most sadistic movies that I've seen Tim Burton put a twist on. I had a sneer on my face from the beginning to the very end. I forced myself to watch the entire movie. You may like it if you liked the book but if you never read the book and enjoyed the original movie then this is not the movie for you.
"
1,"I'm not sure if this is a SPOILER or not, but my opinion. I was really looking forward to seeing this. I like Johnny Depp and I loved the original. I was very disappointed in this for several reasons. 1) I thought it was going to be a Part II and not a remake. Why remake something that was already great? Why not make a movie as Charlie himself grown up and running the factory. 2) Depp is quirky in a freaky, irritating kind of way, often resembling Michael Jackson in a strange way. 3) They ruined all the great songs that were in the original, with completely new, completely irritating, please turn the *@#$ off, it's killing me, kind of songs. 4) Kudos to the one guy who played ALL the oompa loompas.... again pretty strange looking and very digitized.... i like the originals much better instead of exact clone of one. 5) They changed the idea of a lot of the scenes completely... no bad/golden egg for example, no everlasting gobstoppers. 6) My kids didn't like it much either and looked kind of disturbed after the show."
1,"Flat, plodding, awful adaptation of Roald Dahl's extraordinary novel. Once again, Tim Burton demonstrates that he is not a storyteller; he is, in fact, a man lucky enough to be able to surround himself with very talented cinematographers, production designers and publicists. Unfortunately, he has no educated friends who are script editors.

His only brilliant film, ED WOOD, is light years away from this putrid mess and was good because of the script and despite Burton.

One thing Burton is incapable of doing is giving a narrative momentum. In this outing, Wonka takes his children and their guardians on a tour of his factory. We follow the group from room to room and are forced to endure cataclysmically puerile songs from cloned Oompa-Loompahs, all played by the same irritating midget.

The film does not have the darker subplot of the original film and the wheelchair-like pacing drove me close to igniting the screen with the nearest blowtorch.

Johnny Depp is just wrong as Wonka. He's boring, too, because he's a ""weirdo"" who knows he's a weirdo and wants everybody else to know it, too. He's like the annoying guy at a social gathering who tells everybody how crazy he is. No, Mr. Depp, your weirdo is a bore.

The production design is what you'd expect for the fortune spent on this abortion and the cinematography is adequate.

Only the gloriously overrated Tim Burton, who has managed to pull the wool over many people's eyes for over a decade now, could make a rich concept such as this a forgettable bore and a candidate for PND (Permanent Negative Destruction).

As for screenwriter John August (scribe of the rancid BIG FISH), please throw your computer away and retire with Burton."
1,"Such a waste of good talent -- Tim Burton directing, Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka -- how could it be better? It should be great, but they ruined it. Having read and loved the book as a kid, and very much enjoying the first film version, this one doesn't cut it. It's a timeless story and didn't require ""modernizing"" -- keeping with the original story and merely updating the special effects would've been great. Willy Wonka was turned into a Michael Jackson-like character and the Oompa Loompa's were all one actor, digitally duplicated to appear as many identical characters -- the musical numbers with the Oompas were 'updated' with electronic music and Oompas attempting to disco-dance.

This movie is what happens when a bunch of college kids get jobs at studios, do drugs, and dig into the movie-rights vault. Fortunately, there's always the book -- and the first film version -- if anyone could've matched Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka, Johnny Depp could've, but he didn't..."
1,This doesn't hold a candle to the 1971 original classic. Period. Yes the special effects are superior but beyond that it is instantly forgettable. Gene Wilder had a point that this movie had none other than a much needed cash cow for this summer's weaker box office. Johnny Depp is a good actor but this role was completely wrong for him. His choices of playing Wonka as clutzy and spaced out conflicts with the fact Willy Wonka is supposed to be a mastermind of the candy business. Then of course there is the fact Depp's Wonka looks like something out of a Marilyn Manson video no parent with even half of a brain would bring their kids near. Burton's added back story of Wonka's childhood was his standard fare of misunderstood artist who just wants to feel like he fits in the universe. The brilliance of Wilder's performance was the fact he played someone who came across as a nutcase but was in fact a misunderstood genius always a step ahead of everyone else. Then there's the Oompas and their musical numbers. Oy! Half the time it's almost impossible to understand their vocals and what they're singing. I think this movie proves the general movie going public has become as catatonic in the brain as Depp's portrayal in this film. The children and their parents in this film were equally as practically lifeless. No wonder Hollywood is having trouble right now. This is so much of an insult to the 1971 classic that it leaves you wondering what classic they'll ruin next to get an all age audience back into the theatres.
1,"What a sad occasion. I should say at the start that Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors of all time, and that -- until his last three films -- Tim Burton was one of my two favorite directors (the other being Terry Gilliam).

I'm sure Depp will go on to make many more superb films -- but I have no desire to ever see another Tim Burton film again. This film is not only untrue to the book, most monstrously so in its ending (which I can hardly bring myself to describe) but really throughout the film in its cheap, unimaginative, eye-candy.

Depp, apparently channeling a frightening mixture of Pee Wee Herman and Anthony Perkins (thus perhaps the gratuitous ""Psycho"" reference in the film?), is neither charming nor surprising; he lacks the sly warmth of Gene Wilder, who to my mind will *always* be the real Willy Wonka. His factory, resembling the assembly lines of ""Edward Scissorhands,"" but on steroids, is a vast, impersonal cavern, without a single ring of emotional truth. Sure, all the kids but Charlie are brats -- but here, Willie Wonka is one too, and though Charlie may be a good boy, he gets very few speaking lines, and he and Grandpa Joe have as few occasions for fun as do we, the viewers.

During production, Burton talked about how he disliked the older version, and seemed to promise a darker version truer to Dahl's witty disdain for the the adult world. But here, everyone -- child, adult, and elderly person is insulted with visions whose ""darkness"" is not a product of melancholy, but of cynicism. There is no goodness here, no meaningful badness either. The first flashback to Wonka's dentist father (Chrisopher Lee, wonderful as ever) is a lovely touch, but the ending of the film, which demands that little Charlie somehow ""heal"" the wounded psyche of Wonka and re-unite him with his dentist dad, is the worst piece of poisoned treacle ever to leave a factory.

The whole thing ought to be flushed down a garbage chute -- it's a bad nut."
1,"Yes, the title is correct. This was the worst movie I have ever seen.

It left me with a taste in my mouth that sure wasn't sweet like chocolate..

I am a huge fan of the book, and the original movie, and can only think that people who enjoyed this movie have fallen under the ""Johnny"" spell.

Depp, who is actually a BRUTAL actor, only gets any good movie reviews because people are in love with his face. You should wake up and smell the coffee - this movie tried to glorify Johnny Depp at every turn, but instead made him look like the creepy old man that he actually is.

Grow up people. The movie was terrible. Depp is terrible.

Don't waste your money, or your sanity, seeing it."
1,"This is not the only awful film to be made from a children's book in the last few years: Lemony Snicket and Cat in the Hat spring to mind, and certainly, the Harry Potter movies are never much better than mediocre.

But Charlie and the Chocolate Factory suffers from the fact that it must be compared to the Gene Wilder version, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, which is not only superior to it in every way, but is truly a classic film.

One might well ask why anyone would dare to remake a film that was written by Roald Dahl himself. A film that had beautiful, classic songs, biting humor, and a hilarious cast.

The answer, of course, is money.

This film was made for one reason -- to wring more money out of a Warner Brothers property. Why else remake a nearly perfect film? It's an insult to moviegoers and an affront to the many children who may never bother to watch the original now that they've seen this trash.

The thing is, the Gene Wilder version is very, very funny. Its comedy still seems edgy today. And somehow, they've managed to turn it into a movie with almost no laughs. The timing is sometimes, it seems, deliberately thrown off.

Johnny Depp's performance is, I think, his worst ever. It's just stupendously bad. Then again, he has basically nothing to work with, caught between plain, unfunny new dialogue, and struggling to go in the opposite direction from Gene Wilder's brilliance. I don't envy the task. But don't worry, Johnny got lots and lots of money for his troubles.

The new Charlie, Freddie Highmore, was decent enough in the tearjerker Finding Neverland. But here, he's just all wrong. His one acting choice seems to be ""Smile Every Time You Say Something,"" which I last saw used by Denise Richards in Starship Troopers.

On one hand, I wondered as I was watching it whether the movie would fare better with someone who'd never seen the original. But on the other, this film is so disjointed and strange, I'm not sure how anyone could follow it if they hadn't seen the first film.

The Oompa Loompa ""songs,"" if you can call them that, consist of CG clones singing the same rhyming lines over and over again. There is no narrative or melodic progression to the songs -- they are as two dimensional as cardboard cutouts.

Add to this bland, unimaginative mix a few ghastly changes from the earlier movie: Charlie has a father now, his family magically gets ""unpoor"" at the end by the dint of their own optimism, and Willy Wonka learns -- get ready for this one -- that families are not a bad thing.

It's beyond awful. Watch the original again instead, I beg of you."
1,"I did not think a remake of this story should have been made, but when I heard that Johnny Depp was to play Wonka and that Tim Burton would direct I figured if any...these were the people who could pull it off. They simply did not. This film lacks all depth and emotion and all of the bright colors and sweet goo could not bring an honest smile to my face. Where as in both Dahl's fine story and the 1972 film every character had some depth and warmth about them, and I truly felt pulled into a magical space, not without difficulty and pain (as in all of Dahl's work), in this 2005 production I felt as if the editor may has well have shuffled the scenes at random. Watching this film I felt as if I were walking down a cereal isle at a grocery store....surrounded by colors and sounds to entice, but with each box full of promises and distraction....each scene in truth sits isolated from the next, and most all are filled with sugar, artificial colors and air.

All that I can hope is that anyone who cares to enjoy this fine story do so by picking up the book or watching the original film."
1,"I avoided watching this movie for a long time for mainly this reason: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory earned a place in my heart through much thought, discussion, and rewatches. The characters were uncannily well-written and acted out. Not to mention Gene Wilder's positively brilliant acting as Wonka which is in the top 50 performances of the century.

Therefore, a remake of this classic film is positively unwarranted. From the previews you can tell how the whole thing is going to go. Burton's style, beloved from such masterpieces as Beetle Juice and Edward Scissorhands, is becoming more cartoonish and predictable as I felt this lands in the same seam as Sleepy Hollow.

Willy Wonka by Depp is portrayed as a high-pitched jerk. His clean and make-up heavy appearance is completely unattractive. There's no endearment to his personality anymore. He didn't even want to know the children's' names at when he first met them.

There's no more contrast. The whole film is cartoonishly creepy which just felt cheesy and half baked. I mean, I've seen his style before done well, ya know. You can tell this is a step down (or two). There's no more beauty to go along with the mystery. Everything on the screen is suspect and cold.

In conclusion to this small chunk of a very long list of things wrong with this film and the very principle of this film, the first Willy Wonka had a magic and brilliance that cannot be touched and should never have been in the first place. Anybody who likes this film is obviously a rookie who probably liked Batman Forever and should not be trusted.

It simply blows my mind that such a classic film was fooled with by an overactive ego of a director."
1,Would I allow my children to see this movie. No. Do I wish I had not wasted the 4 bucks to rent this movie? Yes. Virginia this is not your mother's Wonka movie. Burton must have been severely beaten as child because his view of the world is horror filled. The music is off key and just plain bad. The visuals are mostly CGI and like the latest Star Wars trilogy lacking in human emotion and reality. Johnny D's version of Wonka is Wonka as Howard Hughs. Creepy and perverse. He reminded me of some weird child molester. Don't waste your money or your time with this remake. Instead rent the original and enjoy the wonderment and beauty of true film making. The music is great and every kid that grew up seeing this favorite can hum the tunes to this day. There's a reason it's a considered a classic like the Wizard of Oz. Tim Burton and Johnny D are two very twisted men and this load of garbage is a bad egg. The original did not need to be remade. It was never broken.
1,"I don't even know where to begin with how disappointed I was with this movie. Having grown up with the incredibly talented Gene Wilder as ""Willy Wonka,"" I expected my view to be tainted, but I tried to watch this film with an open mind. Nice try. Johnny Depp, who has made some wonderful movies in his own right, cannot hold a candle to Gene Wilder in this role. Whereas Wilder played Wonka as mysterious, a bit mischievous, but good-hearted, Depp played him like he had just done a serious amount of cocaine. His dislike for the children was overplayed and I was waiting for him to beat the crap out of them at any moment. Wilder's performance was more subtle and sarcastic. Depp's June Allyson hairstyle did nothing for me either. Whereas ""Willy Wonka..."" was made years before all this computer graphics crap, it seemed more real. ""Charlie..."" seemed like a film student's graduate project. Bottom line: ""Willy Wonka..."" is for adults. ""Charlie..."" is for children with a low I.Q. Some movies just don't need to be remade; in fact most don't. Look at ""Cheaper by the Dozen"" and ""Yours, Mine, and Ours."" The people who made these movies took classic comedy and turned them into fart jokes and basic toilet humor. Doesn't anyone in Hollywood have an original idea? Or has America lost its integrity when it comes to movies? The best movies being made these days are independent films. What does that tell you?"
1,"What. What the deuce. What the diddly deuce did I watch? Tim Burton--you're married to Helena Bonham Carter. You've made several Gothic-cutesy movies which, while decidedly not my style, are not bad. Why did you have to put your cold, spidery hands on my darling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? WHY?? Charlie's not a bad actor. His parents, although rather predictably cast, are cute in that dingy-British-zany-Tim-Burton way. The humor at first is pretty funny. I'm not in love, but I'm not screaming in agony either.

And then Johnny Depp comes. And then Johnny Depp comes. And THEN JOHHNY COMES AND OH, DEAR GOD, I'M BREATHLESS WITH HORROR. He smirks. He simpers. He minces. He speaks in a soft, breathy, braindead sort of voice which seems like a really poor interpretation of Michael Jackson. He's apparently the son of a psychopathic dentist who refusd to let him eat candy--as a result of which, he grows up to be a highly effeminate, suspiciously pedophile-ish creeper who giggles for the camera and doesn't give a darn about the children with whom he's dealing. In short, he's quite possibly the worst Willy Wonka anyone could ever be, ranking right up there with the hypothetical interpretation by Kristen Stewart. Somewhere out there, Dahl is banging his head against his coffin. Personally, I'm a fan of the original. Sure, it changes a few details of the book, sure the Oompa Loompas are green and orange and creepy, sure the infamous Boat Scene is acid-trippy and psychedelic, but the heart is there. Gene Wilder, in my view, played Wonka brilliantly. He was a man of mystery, a man of twinkling eyes and dry humor and unaccountable twists and turns, a man both fearful and wonderful to behold. (By the way, Johnny: dry wit does not equate to you smiling vapidly at the children and lisping ""I don't really care""). He's peculiar, yes, but he's also wacky and whimsical and boyish at heart, and he cares for Charlie. Perhaps Depp's portrayal cared for Charlie, but he gave the impression of said caring being entirely the wrong way. I don't understand why at the end Wonka doesn't allow Charlie to bring his family with him to the factory--that rather defeats the purpose of the book. All in all, this is a shiny new remake which emulates its main character: cold and glassy and completely dissatisfying.

PS. The Oompa Loompas. SERIOUSLY?! And the music completely ruins the mood and setting."
1,"The fault in this film involves a mix of three individuals: 1. Tim Burton, director 2. Danny Elfman, original musical score composer (And this shouldn't surprise many of you out there...) 3. Deep Roy, THE Oompa Loompa

Burton's characters and depictions are dark. Not evil, per se, but just really dark. Edward Scissorhands is a great example of this. Its not an excellent movie, but you must admit that it was a VERY well told story, and thats the directors job. Facilitate the telling of a story, and make sure its done well. All of the characters lived and THRIVED in fantasy. And he (Burton) brought something to the table for them. He made them enjoyable. He made us BELIEVE the fantasy.

So, Tim Burton is obviously a talented director. Why am I listing him as a cause for failure in ""Charlie""? One silly little reason. HE is probably the ONLY reason the other two persons listed had anything to do with the film at all.

Danny Elfman is an incredibly talented composer. That goes without question. But he is NOT talented for THIS type of film, simply put. He works on projects such as ""The Simpsons"", just about anything Pee Wee, ""Weird Science"", and many others. Now I will give him this much credit. He also worked with Burton in Batman and Beetlejuice. These movies, while not famous solely for their score, were scored well all the same. But there is a limit that exists for the man that can give us the theme for The Simpsons. Batman and Beetlejuice were not too different from what ""Charlie"" was supposed to be. So what was up with the different getups for the Oompa Loompa(s)? A rock star? Come on.

And someone please try to justify Deep Roy! Tim Burton, in his every-so-often lapse of wisdom, cast ONE MAN as THE Oompa Loompa for the film. That way, he was SURE to focus most of his attention on the sequences in which Roy is featured, instead of the rest of the film. And so much work went into the dancing sequences... But he can't dance! This guy hasn't done anything of note for the last twenty years except ride on Burton's coattails. His performance in ""Charlie"" was forced, bland, and dry. In and of itself, it is probably is the large reason why I dislike this film.)

I gave it a 1 out of 10. Not because I'm being bitter, but because, honestly, the bad points drug down Depp's struggling but still joyful performance, the delightful selection of ""children"" (well cast, I believe), and anything else of merit that this film had to offer, and I honestly feel that a 1 is all it deserves.

Please read my post on the comment board for ""greater detail."""
1,"To be quite honest, the first make of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory wasn't that much to sneeze at. With Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka, for that time period you knew that it would be a enjoyable movie at that. But the second remake was amusing, literally. Johnny Depp's white-faced, denture wearing, womanly haircutted Willy is embarrassing to look at it in itself compared to the goofy but likable 70's Wonka. With stupid sub plots and scenes that look like hallucinations, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a terrible and embarrassing mistake of a classic musical. Gene Wilder himself told press: ""Why remake a classic?"". I agree 100%. Good to see in the dollar movie or rent but definitely not worth $8.95 of my hard earned money."
1,"Gene Wilder is Right! Why remake a perfect movie? Money.

This movie is just an attempt to make money for the studio and the actors involved. This movie is in one word: insulting This movie ruins the image of Willy Wonka. He is no longer a weird, reclusive, lovable hero. Instead he is a weird distant drug user. Willy Wonka is suppose to be about imagination, hope, and mystery.

The music lyrics were inaudible at times and not in your face like the original.

There isn't any ""oompa Loompa Doompa de do"" with fun loving oompa lumpas. Instead the oompa lumpas are cold faced clones with a cheesy special effect. There isn't any personality to these little guys. And they certainly are not cute in anyway. They are suppose to be weird like cute helpers.

The theme of ""Pure Imagination"" has been removed and there is nothing to hold this film together. Apparently, imagination is lost.

There aren't any lovable characters to speak of.

The acting is good by most of the cast but goes no where. The special effects are very cheesy, a boat in one scene looks like a Disney ride then a model in another.

If you do see this movie, you won't want to see it again.

Another attempt to make money fails. I predict it fail at the box office after the 1st week, and maybe pull in $150 million by the time it hits video. For the $150 price tag, they will only make a few million dollars if they are lucky and they ruined Willy Wonka forever.

Stick with the imagination and hope of Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)"
1,"The original Willy Wonka left things unsaid for us, the Burton remake beats us over the head with elements because we must be too stupid to understand anything. Why does Charlie have to have a dad in the remake? Would it hurt society if he didn't? There is no warmth to the film or the characters. I hated the weird voiced and, at times, mean spirited Wonka. The oompa loompas were terrible and it seemed lazy to me by duplicating one person. I can't go on because I don't remember the other things that bothered me and there is no way that I can put myself through that poor excuse for a movie to refresh my memory. I am trying to repress that part of my memory. Awful."
1,"I just got out of this movie and have to say some things. First of all, for those who read the book, get into the 21st century will you. No one should base their opinion of a movie off of a book. So what if he is closer to the book than the older movie. What kind of biased opinion is that. If you like the book so much go ahead and read it and quit saying the movie is good because it goes with the book. Anyway, just judging this movie off of it's pure entertainment value it sucks. The acting and wooden dialog sunk it. The character development was nil. The sound editing was terrible (I couldn't understand a word the oompa loompa's were singing). There wasn't any emotional investment in any other characters except for Charlie and Wonka. I had no feelings for any of them. It was lacking in humor. So what kind of movie was it? A bad one. Most of the critics out there are blinded by Tim Burton and his ""artistic"" viewpoint. I don't want art. I want entertainment. I feel sorry for the real lessons that could be learned about the kids in this movie. Most of it was really glossed over and their bad habits were less than side stories. The search for the golden ticket wasn't that good either. It was very rushed and each kid got 1 minute to show that they had bad habits. For you book people, I think Charlie's father is actually missing in the book but yet somehow he is alive this whole movie. The original Wonka, the original movie will be forever enshrined in history. This was just awful."
1,"Rarely have I been as depressed coming out of a movie theater as I was last night after seeing Charlie. I have been a Roald Dahl fan my whole life, and Charlie has always been one of my favorite books. That being said, Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have officially been added to my hit list for completely butchering one of the greatest stories ever written.

While Charlie is played exactly by Freddie Highland, Burton rushes through his pre-Golden Ticket story, and as the movie goes on, he seems to forget his presence as a character. In the book, Charlie walks by the factory everyday, longing to get inside and see what's in store. In this movie....nothing. Charlie's magnanimous notion to sell his ticket to make money for his family would have been wonderful, but Burton failed to establish a precedent for it. So sad.

Burton hopes to create a darker, crazier version of Wonka through Johnny Depp, who happens to be one of my favorite actors. What he created, however, was a Wonka who behaves like an infant throughout the entire movie. Depp tries too hard, and comes off as a character with absolutely no depth and no credibility. He has no soul. After meeting Wonka for the first time, I was hoping that at some point, Depp would drop the superficial act and be the dynamic, crazy, enigmatic man who is Willy Wonka. As it is, Depp fails even to show pride for his life's work. He succeeds only at creating forced awkwardness that ruins the allure and character of Wonka. He fails to establish any ownership over his own factory which literally ruins the movie.

As for the dialogue, it felt like it was written by a 3rd grader. Wonka speaks in failed, broken colloquialisms throughout the film. It feels entirely forced, and the dialogue does not allow for the characters to grow.

What was most disappointing about the movie were the moments that gave me hope for how much better it could have been. In the last scene, Wonka and Charlie share a mutual glimmer that had not been seen throughout the entire film. If Burton intended to give Womka a depraved side, he actually came out as an awkward elementary schooler, who seems totally indifferent to absolutely everything around him. The pinnacle of this disaster, is the contrast of Wilder and Depp in reaction to Augustus swimming in the chocolate. While Wilder nearly suffers an emotional breakdown at the sight of fat German hands contaminating his life's work, Depp barely flinches. The lack of heart and soul made this film totally unenjoyable. If there is a positive, it is that I am now driven to read the book and watch the old movie as quickly as possible to restore my love for this fantastic story."
1,"I think this is one of those movies where you are either going to love it or hate it. I fall into the second category. I loved the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka as a kid (my two kids love it as well). I knew going into this that it was supposed to be different and more true to the book. I have never read the book so I can't comment on that but I found the basic story very similar. Anyway, I just didn't like this movie. You can tell right up front that it's a classic Tim Burton movie. Everything is very surreal looking. But I was just bored. I thought once they got to the chocolate factory that things would pick up but no such luck. While I generally like Johhny Depp, I didn't like his portrayal in this movie. I didn't like the way he looked or sounded. And I can definitely see the Michael Jackson comparison (although Depp has said this was not intentional). That just creeped me out even more. There were a couple of good one-liners but that was all I found redeeming about it. My mom put it on for my kids and after a few minutes they asked her if they could watch something else."
1,"I'm sorry I went into this film thinking that I would love it like all the critics views I read. However, this was one of the worse movies I think I've ever witnessed. It was boring & so over the top, I just couldn't get into it. Johnny Depp as always was good but the voice he used for Willy Wonka was irritating. It was to the point that at the end of the film I wanted to reach in & choke Willy Wonka just so I wouldn't have to hear the voice anymore. The coloring didn't make any sense either, he was always either green, blue or pale colored. Depended upon what scene he was in. He just looked sickly. He had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I didn't see the need for the incredibly stupid flashbacks to his childhood. It made no sense in the picture & was irritating. The Umpahs were OK... I didn't like the singing because most the time we couldn't understand what they were singing about. I thought the kids were fairly good. I really liked this kid who played Charlie much better than the original... he was good. I've always been a fan of Tim Burton but I know he's done much better."
1,"Never in my life would I have expected it to have been as awful as it was. This film will (read should) make it up to the ranks of films such as Ishtar. It makes Showgirls look like Shakespeare. The film was full of pointless imagery, and disturbing visuals. All of the children, with the exception of Mike Tevee and Charlie have been dressed in make up to like living china dolls. Violet's mom looks like a psychotic killer who just escaped from Archam. The list goes on. Disturbing to say the least. Watch this film with caution. . I can only say I feel bad for anyone who pays money for this film. For the children who are introduced to Dahl's magical storytelling through the vehicle of Tim Burton. And just like an old Chevy truck, Tim isn't firing on all cylinders. The film seems like it was made by someone who likes listening to the sound of his own voice. It was the equivalent of watching two hours of Jar-Jar talk about the pre-colonial economies. It was just that bad."
1,"Sorry to report: Don't bother. Please. I'm glad I waited until we could order it through the digital cable, rather than shell out the bucks and sit through the whole thing with two young squirmy kids. Depp is simply creepy and entirely unrelatable. I liked the bratty kids better than his Wonka-- not the way it's supposed to be. We saw Charlie and the Chocolate Factory in a Junior Theatre live production-with an all kid cast- that was way more entertaining. Burton seems unable to decide whether he's going to go all-out crazy, over the top, Nightmare before Christmas/edward scissorhands surreal, or make it into a genial kids' movie, and flops. The Wilder version is better. I thought at least the effects would be better, or the movie would be visually better. It's not. Very disappointing. The parts with Charlie's parents/grandparents are the best/most interesting spots in the film, and that shouldn't be. Save it for when it appears on TV. We ended up fast forwarding through a lot of it-- that's how boring it was. Ouch!"
1,"This was an appalling movie. I think it would be terrifying and disturbing for children, not to mention the fact it is just plain creepy most of the time. I love dark movies, and couldn't believe how bad it was. I loved the book, and the original movie, but this one just plain stinks. To go from Captain Jack Sparrow to this Chester Molester character makes me not like Johnny Depp so much any more. The Oompa Loompa is just horrible - computer generated and gross. Only 4 or 5 chuckles for both myself and my boyfriend. (We're both in our 30's.) Don't waste your time, in my opinion. And if your children are easily spooked, this is definitely not the movie for them. I was most disappointed."
1,"I loved the book and the first movie, and I was looking forward to this new movie with great anticipation. (Especially when I heard Johnny Depp was to be Willy Wonka.) However, after seeing it, I cannot imagine any way to make it worse. Willy Wonka, instead of being depicted as the eccentric genius he is supposed to be, is portrayed as a sissy pervert. He looks, talks, and acts like a cross between Michael Jackson and Pewee Herman. Grandpa Joe was also terrible. The oompa loompa songs should have been scrapped altogether, as they were the worst part of the original movie. But instead, they were transformed into some kind of Marylin Manson type freak-show. I hated it and could not wait for it to be over."
1,"Johnny Depp played some cross between Michael Jackson and Gary Coleman, not the mysterious old man portrayed by Gene Wilder in the original. Depp acted disturbed and perversely childish. Tim Burton took too many liberties, significant parts of the story from the book that were included in the original were cut from this movie. The ending tried to tack on a message about the importance of family, however that failed miserably. The music was probably the worst part, the songs were not cute and catchy, but jazzy and Vegas-like, with unintelligible lyrics sung by Deep Roy (Umpa Luma). Roy was also miss-cast looked too much like a human which detracted from the illusion. Visuals took little advantage of the advances in technology over the past few decades, some scenes such as the chocolate room (chocolate meadow and river) were much more elaborate in the original despite being filmed 35 years earlier. Finally, there were a lot of inconsistencies of time and place which did not seem purposeful and detracted from the story.
"
1,"This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. Save your time and rent the original. Johnny Depp should be killed. If I ever see Tim Burton I will beat him to a bloody pulp! Complete crap. Worse than crap. I would rather watch crap for a few hours. So bad It's still playing in my DVD player as I write this. Gene Wilder should really sue someone. Did I say this movie sucked. I can't remember. Please let me post this. I can't take it anymore! The songs are ridiculous. The acting is terrible (except for Charlie, he is always wonderful). It's STILL playing in my DVD played. Please IMDb let me finish this already, the people need to know!!!"
1,"I have never in my life thought so badly of a film. I love movies. I especially love remakes of old movies, and sequels to old movies. How could anyone make the original any worse??? The original movie staring Gene Wilder was only worth watching,...because of Gene Wilder! The remake? I would not pay money to see it again,...I would not TAKE money to see it again. I am so disappointed.

Although the trailers and its creator made me slightly wary, I could never have been prepared for the bad acting,...the disco oompa loompa(s), or how poor in taste this movie was. They made Wonka a nut,...and I wont even go into why."
1,"To begin with, I realize that this version is closer to the novel, I also realize that the filmwork and casting was overall pretty good, but I still hated it, and here's why: This is not a happy movie, this is not ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", and Johnny Depp is not Gene Wilder, and you realize these points from the beginning. One thing that really, really bothered me about this picture were the oompa loompas. Now I understand that Burton made it a point to avoid the staple, cookie cutter oompa loopma design, but these newer ones lack whimsy, and resemble shrunken ethnic men. None of the original music is here, which goes without saying because the obvious point of the movie is to prove that Burton can remake a movie without resorting to the old stuff from the original. However, the newer stuff looks like crap in contrast to the stuff that we were introduced to thirty years ago. I found this movie extremely depressing overall, and everything that I really liked in the original is really different in this version.

On the other hand, I have thought for years that Johnny Depp hasn't made a good movie since ""Edward Scissorhands"", and although I really disliked this flick, his performance was pretty good. The likability factor for this movie really depends solely on your loyalty and love for the original."
1,"As far as I'm concerned, they took what was a perfectly good children's movie and remade it into some sort of demented freak show with an evil feel to it. I wouldn't bother to record it, let alone spend my money to buy a copy of this atrocious piece of modern garbage. Johnny Depp is the worst, in this movie. His character is somewhere between homosexual and the devil himself. Willy Wonka was supposed to be neurotic, not evil and mean spirited. In fact, the only good character in the whole movie is David Kelly as Grandpa Joe. I can even deal with Freddie Highmore as Charlie but the rest of it is full of deplorable performances and like I said, an evil and mean spirited overtone. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone with small children as it will most likely give both, the children and their parents nightmares.

Nuff said.."
1,"This movie was unbelievable. Tim Burton took a great story and absolutely destroyed it. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have to be honest and the fact that I love ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" and were constantly comparing the two contributed highly to my opinion. I am sure i would have disliked the film either way, but I hated it when I compared the two.

Willy Wonka, instead of being a nice but eccentric individual, is portrayed as a sadistic, mentally retarded man. The OOmpa LOOmpas, instead of being cute and benevolent, are portrayed as futuristic and violent troublemakers. The biggest disappointment however is Charlie Bucket himself. In the 1971 film, Charlie was portrayed as a gentle child, very poor, living with his mother and two sets of bed-ridden grandparents. Most importantly, his character was believable. In the 2005 film Charlie is apparently supposed to be the perfect child. The performance is so over-the-top and sappy that it's not even remotely believable.

To top everything off, for some reason Burton decided that adding a back story about Willy Wonka's relationship with his father was a necessary addition. Unfortunately, this just made no sense, was completely irrelevant to the story except to add a Hollywood ending where everybody reconciles and live happily ever after.

The bottom line is that after watching the 1971 film, I have a feeling that I just watched something magical. From the story, to the characters, to the design, everything about the 1971 film makes me feel good. On the other hand, after viewing the 2005 film by Tim Burton, I literally felt physically ill. Frankly, if it weren't for the fact that I wanted to compare both films, I never would have watched the entire thing. I could tell it would be a horrible film after the first few minutes.

Don't buy this film unless you need a shiny new frisbee or coaster."
1,"I don't get the voting on this movie. Talk about stuffing the ballot box. Johnny Depp should be ashamed of himself and so should Tim Burton. I can't think of one thing good to say about this movie except when the credits rolled. I don't know who Depp was trying to be here, but it didn't work. A cross between his Ed Wood character and Michael Jackson it seems but done really bad. Just because Tim Burton and Depp are involved doesn't mean it should be given a thumbs up. The Burton/Depp groupies are definitely at work here with liking this turd. Hey Hollywood, do the world a favor and stop making remakes and comic book stories. How about an original idea???? Tha would be nice...."
1,"Can't rate this any lower, but if there were a cringe factor then it would get a 10. I found it 'nearly' as bad as Blair witch project (only this was in color!). As i grew up with the original I class it as a classic. This movie will be quickly forgotten due to the slow, boring and unexciting script and storyline.

The story starts out well enough but the agonizing slow and unspectacular way Charlie finds the golden ticket is reflective to the rest of the movie.

Not going to the movies all that often i was looking forward to relaxing and watching what i thought would be and entertaining movie. The closest i've ever been to walking out of a movie. This is two hours of my life i'll never get back.. Don't let it happen to you!

To other people who have commented favorably to this movie.. Where you watching the same movie as i did or are your expectations of Hollywood really that low or are your paid by the producers to write your entry in IMDb. I found more entertainment in reading the back of my movie ticket."
1,"This is a so-so adaption of the book. However I love the first movies lovable brats! This film not even Charlie is lovable!

The original movie has a heart. You liked the bratty children and Willy Wonka because were relate-able. No so in this version. The original also had a very magical spirit to it. This movie has no heart or soul! It is creepy.

In the first movie The children were regular children. In this version we have ""Hollywood Children"". There is a bigger budget for this production but that was not an improvement.

This movie has has ""Millions to spare"" on special effects. Since these effects are done in post production the children in this production had nothing to act to when they shot their part. So they are emotionally not involved in the scenes which harms this film!

The film is over produced.(They have 1 man play all the om pa- lompas). However the best thing they did with the millions was the demise of Veruca Salt. They were able to do the squirrels (that was in the book). However I like the first movie's Veruca Salt's better.

Johnny Depp plays Wonka like he is Michael Jackson. So that means he is just creepy. In The book Wonka isn't a creep! He loves children! In this movie he isn't a nice person! I am sure this movie will be a box office hit! I just hope if they do ""Charlie and great glass elevator"" they will make it with care. In fact they should let Chris Columbus direct it!

Tim Burton is good in worlds of his own creation but his bizarre touch harms the overall effect of this film .

Do yourself a favor buy the original film and pass on this!"
1,"I know i shouldn't be judging this movie before i see it but i cant bear to watch!!! There once was a time in America when kids wouldn't think of whats on TV or who likes whom but now everything has changed. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is a classical movie of a simple boy and they changed it to make the movie rude and todays modern kids. I absolutely hate this whole making movies newer and funnier with insulting comments. I cant believe people would pay to see this. I know i should see this movie before i make comments on it but i cant stand to see old classical movies that are harmless and sweet turn to gross movies with Johny Depp in it. Now people wont listen to the morals in this movie but just stare at Johnny because he's SO hot or something. what happened to those sweet musicals kids would adore and actually learn something from?? I personally don't think the movie should have been changed and made worse and more like what kids watch today, crude humor, insulting and little people hopping around."
1,"After suffering through the incredibly boring and 'bad-taste' version of this '70s classic only one good thing came out of it: I decided to join this movie review site and check every movie BEFORE I bring my kids to the theater. Don't even dream about wasting your money buying the DVD!!!!

The adorable oompa loompas that I remembered from the previous version were substituted by boring, unattractive copies of mechanical dancers. The scenes of Charlie as an abused boy were disgusting and not appropriate for children. No kid laughed even once during the whole movie!!! that should tell critics something!!!Innocence, laughter, creative mystery and funny jokes are not a part of this movie. Just because technology is there to make movies it doesn't make a movie is good or worth watching. Depp is a wonderful actor and that saved the movie in a way but I'd like to see him be more careful in choosing the movies he makes for children. This is a negative step in his career. What a shame!"
1,"Johnny Depp is a strange, quite bad, scraggly-looking actor. Tim Burton decided to swank up and nice, happy-go-lucky children's story into his ""Look at me I'm Tim Burton and I will swank up this movie and show you how swank I am"" movie. In addition, Willy Wonka never looked like a pimp, as he does in the movie, with a face that looks like it's made out of plastic. By the way the self-indulgent claptrap trailer that the audience hissed at, is no different than what one visualizes when on a trip of acid and/or LSD. Another thing, I'm pretty sure Johnny Depp is imitating Michael Jackson. Well anyways, my point is, don't see this incoherent, swanky, acid-trip like, lame embarrassment to the cinematic arts."
1,"First of all - I think IMDb needs to trash the first 7-9 pages of user comments because those are obviously mostly people who are being paid to promote the film. Now in the later pages we're getting the true comments or so it seems.

Johnny Depp completely botched the role of Willy Wonka. Willy Wonka was never intended to be a weird hermit. Willy Wonka was supposed to be the rich, wise,affectionate uncle you never knew you had. Willy Wonka was the Walt Disney of Chocolate. He was the Clarence from It's a Wonderful Life, the guy who says the right thing at the right time. He's the Candy Man. He is the Wizard from the Wizard of Oz. He is the benefactor who makes all of your dreams come true because he, unlike the rest of the world understands your heart even though the world cannot see it. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for they will inherit the kingdom as the beatitudes say.

Bottom line: Depp completely missed the mark by portraying it like Michael Jackson, a man who cannot relate to kids or people in general. Depp did a splendid job in Sleepy Hollow and Pirates of the Caribbean but he clearly did not 'get it' with respect to this film.

Also to note: The German glutton kid had no eyebrows. Satan in The Passion of the Christ also had no eyebrows. Either way it is scary and just wrong for a film like this.

The homage to Edward Scissorhands as the doors was a cool throw in if you caught it. (As the ribbon to the factory is cut, Depp is clearly Ed Scissorhands once again.) I'm not sure I understood the reference to Disney's Matterhorn Bobsled ride as they rode the glass elevator. It was clearly Disneyland's Matterhorn complete with climbers bearing in bright jackets like Disneyland.

All in all, while this film had some funny moments, it completely lacks the charm and wonder of the first film. My advice is that this film goes to a quick and well deserved death in the graveyard of bad films with big sets. Save 9 bucks and go see the Real Willie Wonka ... Gene Wilder."
1,"This ""remake"" was nothing compared to the original; it was produced just to cash in on American youth, and it is incredibly demeaning that it reached such a height of popularity. It was advertised as more true to the book; I didn't read the book, I don't give a rat's @$$ about it; the original film was a work of pure genius made only apparent by today's standards. Common movie goers have to realize that the film weighs communism against capitalism: Non-union workers, an entrepreneur choosing an heir, the squalor that Charlie and his grandfather live in! Come on people! The original Willy Wonka contains so much more than people initially realize!"
1,"I regret going to this film, more so than when I went to see Spice World when I was 10. Shame! Shame on you Johnny Depp! Your face is on Hostess cupcakes now, and my dreams are ruined. Shame on you Tim Burton! I don't know what to say...man hath not created anything lamer, and I'm sure God sorely regrets having ever created man because of this. This is not blind criticism. Compare this to all the wonderful things Hollywood produced back in the day. Sunset Boulevard, 8 1/2, my God, Battleship Potemkin. And don't tell me about escapism, Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers' mindless fluff had more wit than this. Escapism is not supposed to embarrass you, and this movie made me flush. Johnny Depp acted like an idiot. None of the kids had any personality or acting talent, the grown ups were cardboard, and the oompa loompas were one guy digitally made smaller (death to all things digital) and multiplied. Oh, and one had a baritone voice, how funny is that? How funny are inside Hollywood references and pop references? It is so embedded in the idiotic current ideology (parodies of pop culture, bad humor, political correctness up the ass), that it turns bland and one forgets it the next day. Who is going to remember this 20 years from now? No one. As far as all new movies go I am taking on a strictly Holden Caufield attitude. They are crummy. They suck. I hate it. I'm moving to Rwanda with a VCR and taped TCM tapes. And Tim Burton should be made to visit R.D.'s grave and place a letter of apologies on it."
1,"The 1971 Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is one of the best kids movies of all time, Gene Wilder is wonderful, it's charming, has memorable songs, great effects and set design considering it's low budget and age and terrific performances from the child actors. Everyone knows that movie.

The Tim Burton remake is just a bad movie. I like some of Tim Burton's movies and i think Depp is a great actor but this is a major misfire. Depp's Willy Wonka acts like he has mental problems, the songs are loud and obnoxious so you can't even make out what the lyrics are supposed to be and it all has that signature Tim Burton visual style which i do enjoy but it's so overdone now it's become a cliche. Also the dry, sarcastic humor from the 1971 version has been replaced with annoying ""random"" and wacky nonsense and awkward silences like it's an episode of The Office or something.

Avoid this dumpster fire and get your kids to watch the 1971 version, they'll love it."
1,"I found this movie to be a horrible remake of the movie, Wonka's 'catchphrases' were not amusing. If a child went to see this who has never seen the old one, then I believe they would enjoy it. But to anyone who loves the old one, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, I believe you will find this remake horrible. Johnny Depp reminded me of Michael Jackson in this movie. The oompa loompas were Mexicans that are the size of your ankle. But the story line was altered. This movie made me bored, and I wanted to walk out.

Although, as far as a children's movie it was fine. Tim Burton, I think, was trying to alter it make it less weird for the children of today to understand. The original one was more designed for teenagers. This is just in my aspect. The original had 'scary' things in the tunnel and Willy Wonka came off as creepy more than weird.

Final decision, if you have a child who has never heard of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, go see it, the kids love it. However, if you have watched the original thousands of times, do not go to this movie.

Thanks, there is my 2 cents.
"
1,I am so glad I decided to preview this movie(since it was from Tim Burton) before taking my children. Now I only wish I had the cost of my ticket back. Johnny Depp is NO Wonka! He is just creepy through the entire movie! The Oompa Loompas leave much to be desired this time. The original movie was fun whereas this one is just weird! The kid that played Charlie was OK but the other kids were just boring. While this movie may be closer to the original story just thought it to be a waste of my time. I really don't think that Dahl envisioned Wonka as an over feminine wacko. IMO rent the original and watch it at home! This movie was a HUGE disappointment!
1,"Clearly the studio shills/plants are out in force for this dud. Word of mouth should be just dreadful.

Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka is downright creepy. He vacillates from kid-hating to having an almost pedophiliac attraction to them. And that's when the sensation jells. His outrageous wardrobe, his sallow, flawless skin, his pageboy haircut make him look eerily like the eerie Michael Jackson. That image and thought certainly yanked me out of the moment every time he appeared (which didn't begin until the film was one-third over).

The film adds another subchapter to the book's ending, but otherwise follows the original storyline, with poorer-than-dirt Charlie finally finding one of five golden invitations to visit the Wonka chocolate factory.

Settings inside the plant reviews, this movie is just awful.

Unlike ""Willy Wonka,"" Burton's film isn't a musical. But it has several musical production numbers in it, all featuring the omnipresent Oompa-Loompas. Shifting gears from the uneasy comedy to the song-and-dance segments is one of the great transitory troubles here. Stay Away."
1,"I enjoyed Johnny Depp in ""Pirates of the Caribean"" so I must put the development of his freakish character on the head of the Director Tim Burton. From start to finish, I found myself thinking, ""I wouldn't let my kid near this guy."" He has all the behaviorisms of Michael Jackson. High voice with girl-like laugh, emasculated face and hair, old guy trying to act and be like a child. Hell, even the parents of the kids are continually weirded out by the nut-job they portray Willy to be. I could go on....

So beyond the freak show that is Wonka Jackson, the rest of the movie will leave you wondering, ""why the attempt at a laugh every 10 seconds?"". I am positive kids will not get the intended message. After all the identical 100uplets jive to a beat that hides the lyrics but to the most attune.

The movie plot boils down to the Simpson episode where Bart & Lisa attempt to reunite Crusty the Clown with his father and live happily ever after."
1,"When I first heard that Tim Burton and Johnny Depp were going to do their own version of Roald Dahl's Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, I was very intrigued. It seemed like a great idea. But, although I admire much of the work they've done in the past, I do think they've botched this one.

Burton's visuals are cool, but I get the feeling he was more interested in the LOOK of the film and should've paid more attention to the script and characterization. How hard can it be to adapt such a great story? I don't see how he can claim this version is faithful to Roald Dahl's book, when for instance, Burton decided to create a completely unnecessary ""daddy issues"" backstory for Willy Wonka. Not to mention the whole ""Wonka hates children"" idea. And various instances of inappropriate humour and disturbing imagery. If you want to make a darker, more ""adult"" Willy Wonka, don't market it to kids and families! But of course, then they wouldn't have a summer blockbuster.

Johnny Depp also disappoints, and I'm speaking as someone who thought Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka could use improvement. I was not a big fan of Wilder's film and I was hoping Depp would really capture the character as written in the book. Turns out, Gene Wilder was better, with his portrayal of Wonka's sly humour and mischievous nature. Johnny Depp's performance brings to mind characters he's played in the past, like Ed Wood. And, oh god, Michael Jackson. This is not a good thing. Just because Willy Wonka has been reclusive/secretive for years, does not mean he should be played as socially inept or creepy. Bad acting decision on Depp's part.

By the end of the film, we should be happy for Charlie escaping his miserable life and being rescued by Willy Wonka and his Chocolate Factory. So you know there's a BIG problem when you find yourself concerned for Charlie and urging him to get away from the freaky man. Especially since Wonka says Charlie can't bring his family to live at the Factory with them!

Please, people... just read the book and use your imagination. It really is the best way. We can't depend on Hollywood to get it right."
1,"This movie has the worst acting I have ever seen.If you have ever seen the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, this does not compare in the least. There were also some parts that I thought were scary for younger viewers. but in any case, although my 10 yr old thought it was OK, we still vote for the original movie as the best (as it usually is). If you haven't seen it yet..save your money... and rent it when it comes out on DVD. I just want to say it was sooooooooo baaaaaaaaaaad. Johnny Depp was awful as Mr. Wonka and none of other characters had any appeal..maybe I would give a few points to Charlie but thats about it. To those who have not seen the original, this movie may have made them laugh..like the girl next to me who was laughing practically the entire time,while i on the other hand, was counting the minutes until it was over."
1,"We endured Big Fish, we even managed to swallow Planet of the Apes, however, a man who was once a king amongst directors (back in the good old days of Batman, Beetlejuice, Scissorhands) has sadly passed away and resorted to making pointless tripe that is little more than a step up from the Teletubbies!!!! Though I have seriously disliked Burton's latest 'sell out' movies, I have to say that even THIS was too awful for him! I would liken it more to The Cat in the Hat or The Grinch. The character's are completely 1 dimensional wierdos (even Charlie and his family who are supposed to be the warm, familiar, human side of the story) and none of the actor's appear to have no chemistry whatsoever (even Charlie and Depp, who I thought worked well in Finding Neverland together).

Traditionally, you would expect the Burton version to be much darker than the original, however, in this case, the original is the darker of the 2, whereas Burton's version is more like an episode of 'My Little Pony!' I would recommend this film maybeye to a 14year old girl who owns a Jack Skeleton backpack, listens to 'My Chemical Romance' and thinks that Donnie Darko is "" Like, the cleverest cult film ever!!!"" But to anyone with a brain, I hope you will see it for the tedious, pointless and stupid pile of rubbish it is and say ""Forget Corpse Bride Burton! You've just had your last chance!!!!!"""
1,"Tim Burton's genius only goes so far. When I first heard of this remake (or not if you believe what they say), I thought to myself, ""Why would anyone want to mess with an absolute CLASSIC?"" Attention all movie producers/directors: LEAVE THE CLASSICS ALONE! Johnny Depp is a pasty/ghoulish/creepy Michael Jackson look alike...there could not have been a worse choice for the role of Willy Wonka. I believe Burton's love of Depp has unfortunately biased his judgment...yes, Depp is a good actor. But that does not mean he is right for every role.

The attempts at humor were just that - for there was nothing funny here. My theater was filled with adults and kids and after each joke you could hear the crickets chirping. I heard one person wonder out loud, ""Was that supposed to be funny?"" The music, although updated for today's kids, was so loud and obnoxious you couldn't hear most of the words of the Oompa Loompas, which were, BTW, a total disaster. One guy cloned? Oh, come on. Use CG only when you need it.

The characters had no depth, the acting wasn't so great, and damn...I just can't get over what a bad job Johnny Depp was at being Willy Wonka.

I've never read the book so I don't know how close this movie related, but I was expecting to hear ""the schnazzberries taste like schnazzberries"". It's a part of our vernacular (ref. the first ten minutes of 'Super Troopers'). What a disappointment to not have this in the movie.

Now that I've thought more about it, holy cow it was bad. I mean it physically hurt to sit through this movie.

Tim, The Nightmare Before Christmas is where your genius shined. Stick to those kinds of movies...and you'll be fine (you'll be happy to know I do plan to see ""The Corpse Bride"").

Hey, Depp, you're now typecast as a drunken pirate. Please don't do anything else but that.

Gene, sleep well knowing you'll never be replaced as Willy Wonka.

And for the last time, folks, LEAVE THE CLASSICS ALONE."
1,"To begin with, the music was horrendous. The Oompa Loompas in general were, like the rest of the film, butchered. They were not colorful, in the least, they wore tight plastic, sang horribly and every Oompa Loompa was played by the same character.

And Willy Wonka!! He was flat out cruel! The audience was supposed to connect with him, feel sorry for him! I understand his disgust for the other four children, but even towards Charlie and his grandfather he was cruel. And what was with the flash backs? Those were obnoxious and entirely pointless.

I understand they were necessary for the ending. But it, too, was butchered. The original ending made me want to cry and it had a real moral to it. I don't even know what to say about this new one.

All I have to say is that I hope parents have enough sense to rent the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory for their children, because it would be a shame to have to grow up with this version."
1,"i am giving this movie one star instead of 0 only because i enjoyed the preview for ""March of the Penguins"" narrated by Morgan Freedman prior to the movie. Penguins are the coolest animals in the world. they have wings but don't fly, they are birds, but like to swim. they are fluffy and waddle around and even like to slide on their tummies.

on the other hand, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was one of the worst i have seen in ages. I loved the original, and yet this movie seemed to replicate it almost identically, yet it removed the best parts of the original, and replaced it with a 'futuristic' twist of crap and annoyance.

kill me now. Tim Burton, i will be awaiting your check in the mail."
1,"For butchering Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, one of the best stories of all time.

Except for the ending the remake was very close to the original, only with the charm, humor, and drama removed. Virtually every line of dialog was lame. Almost every comedic and dramatic opportunity was squandered. The biggest laughs came when Depp walked into a glass wall, gee thats clever.

Johnny Depp is one of my favorite actors, but making Willy Wonka into an insecure Micheal Jackson man child was a horrible creative decision. As was revealing Wonka's past in vivid detail, including how he found the oompa loompas, destroyed the air of mystery behind the character.

The ending was a horrible - meet with the estranged father and heal his psychological wounds - piece of Hollywood crap.

Even visually, the film wasn't as good as I expected. It was vivid and detailed but again, lacked charm.

After this and the miserable Planet of the Apes, I hope Burton never does a remake again. I like his other movies a lot."
1,"This movie is a waste of money and time. The original is better, with more substance, better directing, and better musical numbers.

This is crap. The movie is all over the place. The performances are half-baked, and I hate to say it, but Johnny Depp (who I love) is all over the place, and completely improbable. The only thing it's got going for it is amazing visuals, but what's good visuals without a story?

Plus, the visuals were out of place and over the top. Nothing in the dam movie made sense.

Oh, the only good thing about the movie is Charlie. The kid who plays Charlie is brilliant. He's going to be an Oscar winner some day."
1,"As a boy I read the book at least 100 times. When the movie came out in 1971 I was 9 years old. I did not make comparisons between the book and the movie and eventually the movie became the way I remembered the story. Such a classic is the movie that comparisons between this movie and the original are inevitable, and that forms the basis for my review.

The first scene shows us the 5 golden tickets being placed on the candy bars. So already we are robbed of the surprise factor that the original has. The 5 tickets are placed on consecutive bars and apparently put into the same box...yet they end up all over the world. Also, we are told in a narration that Charlie will find one the tickets. Once again, the suspense aspect is lost in the remake.

The finding of the golden tickets occurs far too quickly. The original succeed in allowing us to agonize with Charlie as the tickets are found one by one. The original also depicts a more realistic view of the lengths to which the world tried to find the tickets. Also, there was no time interval at all between the time that Charlie finds out that the fifth ticket was a fake and he finds the fifth ticket.

The scene outside the factory lacks all the hoopla of the original. The fact that Wonka does not appear to the public in the remake is quite believable, but the ""It's a small world"" tribute to Wonka is not.

Willy Wonka comes across as a cross between a sadistic game show host and a pedophile. The scene involving Veruca Salt getting attacked by squirrels is quite disturbing as Wonka pretends to find the correct key to allow Mr. Salt to rescue his daughter.

The Oompa Loompa songs were the only thing I liked about the remake. Although the last song becomes tiresome with its endless imitations of famous musicians and groups.

Charlie Bucket is very likable, but he does not get enough screen time in a movie which is supposed to be about him.

Grandpa Joe is portrayed decently...but he cannot match the performance of Jack Albertson.

Veruca Salt lacks the whininess of the original. She is not credible as someone who gets her own way by throwing tantrums.

Mr. Salt comes across as one who is not controlled by his daughter, yet he caters to her every whim. This is a blatant contradiction.

Augustus and Mrs. Gloop were fine.

Mike Teevee claims to be some sort of genius who calculated the location of one of the tickets. Doesn't he know that this is a random event? And to call Wonka Vision a teleporter shows that he knows nothing about the conservation of mass. Then we again see the sadistic side of Wonka again as Teevee is repeatedly pummeled by Oompa Loompas and Rock-em Sock-em robots.

All of the flashbacks to Wonka's childhood add very little to the story. In the original we learn right away that Wonka is a little bit kooky and we are left to wonder why. Explaining it all by saying his dad was a dentist and would not let him eat candy is ludicrous. And what a waste of talent with Christopher Lee as the dad.

Lastly, I think Tim Burton's influence showed too heavily on this movie. Perhaps if I liked his work I would have a more favorable view. But as I said, the comparisons between this movie and the original are inevitable. The original is a great classic and the remake is destined to be a horrible flop. Thanks for reading."
